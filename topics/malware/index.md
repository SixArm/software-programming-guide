# Malware

Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any type of software designed to harm, exploit, or take unauthorized control of a computer system, network, or device. Malware is a broad term that encompasses a range of different types of software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, adware, and more.

Malware is typically spread through a variety of methods, including email attachments, infected websites, malicious software downloads, social engineering, and more. Once installed on a computer or device, malware can carry out a variety of malicious actions, depending on the type of software and the intentions of the attacker.

Typical attacks:

Steal sensitive data: Steal passwords, financial information, and personal data, and transmit it back to the attacker.

Take control of a computer: Execute commands, access files, and carry out other actions on the compromised system.

Spread malware to other systems: Spread to other systems on a network or the internet, allowing the attacker to infect more systems and expand their control.

Ransomware: Encrypt a victim's files, and demand payment in exchange for the decryption key.

Adware: Display unwanted advertisements on a user's computer, often leading to poor system performance and frustrating user experiences.
