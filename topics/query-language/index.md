# Query language

A query language is a specialized programming language used to interact with databases and retrieve specific information from them. It allows users to query, manipulate, and manage data stored in a database without needing to understand the underlying database structure or implementation details.

Some query languagesâ€¦

Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL is the most widely used query language for relational databases. It allows users to interact with tables, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), filter data using conditions, join multiple tables, and aggregate data.

XQuery: XQuery is a query language designed for querying XML documents. It enables users to extract specific data from XML files and perform transformations on the XML structure.

SPARQL: SPARQL is a query language used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, commonly used in semantic web applications.

GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request specific data they need, making it more efficient and flexible than traditional REST APIs.
