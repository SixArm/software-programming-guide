# Query language

A query language is a specialized programming language used to interact with databases and retrieve specific information from them. It allows users to query, manipulate, and manage data stored in a database without needing to understand the underlying database structure or implementation details.

There are several types of query languages, each designed for different database models and purposes.

Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL is the most widely used query language for relational databases. It allows users to interact with tables, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), filter data using conditions, join multiple tables, and aggregate data.

XQuery: XQuery is a query language designed for querying XML documents. It enables users to extract specific data from XML files and perform transformations on the XML structure.

SPARQL: SPARQL is a query language used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, commonly used in semantic web applications.

GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request specific data they need, making it more efficient and flexible than traditional REST APIs.

These are just a few examples of query languages used in specific contexts. Each query language is designed to work with a particular database model or data format, providing a way for users to retrieve relevant information effectively and efficiently. Understanding query languages is essential for developers and database administrators working with databases and data-driven applications.
