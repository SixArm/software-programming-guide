# Cryptography algorithms

Cryptography algorithms are techniques and mathematical procedures used to secure data and communications by transforming plaintext (original data) into ciphertext (encrypted data) in such a way that only authorized parties can decipher and read the information. Cryptography plays a vital role in ensuring data privacy, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation in various applications, including secure communication, e-commerce, and data protection. There are numerous cryptographic algorithms, each serving specific purposes.

Common categories of cryptographic algorithms and an example of each…

Symmetric Key Algorithms (Private Key Cryptography): In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It is fast and efficient but requires secure key exchange between parties. Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used block cipher.

Asymmetric Key Algorithms (Public Key Cryptography): Asymmetric key cryptography uses a pair of public and private keys. Data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other key. It provides key exchange and digital signatures. Example: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely-used algorithm for secure key exchange and digital signatures.

Hash Functions: Hash functions take an input (message or data) and produce a fixed-size hash value. They are used for data integrity verification and password storage. Example: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is part of the SHA-2 family, widely used for data integrity verification.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): PKI is not a single algorithm but a framework that includes various cryptographic algorithms and standards to manage digital certificates, key distribution, and secure communication.  Components: X.509 is a standard defining the format of digital certificates; Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted entities that issue digital certificates; digital certificates contain public keys and information about the certificate holder.

Symmetric Key Exchange Protocols: These protocols facilitate the secure exchange of symmetric keys for use with symmetric encryption algorithms. Example: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Allows two parties to securely exchange a shared secret key.

Digital Signature Algorithms: Digital signature algorithms provide authentication and non-repudiation by allowing a user to sign a message or document. Example: DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) is a dedicated digital signature algorithm.

Block Ciphers and Stream Ciphers: Block ciphers work on fixed-size blocks of data, while stream ciphers encrypt data bit by bit or byte by byte. Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a block cipher, and RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) is a stream cipher.

Homomorphic Encryption: Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data without revealing the plaintext. It is used in secure cloud computing and privacy-preserving data analysis. Example: LWE (Learning With Errors)-based schemes.

Post-Quantum Cryptography: With the advent of quantum computers, post-quantum cryptography focuses on algorithms that remain secure even in a post-quantum world. Example: Lattice-based Cryptography using NTRUEncrypt.

Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies rely on cryptographic algorithms for transactions and blockchain security. Example: Bitcoin uses elliptic curve digital signatures (ECDSA).
