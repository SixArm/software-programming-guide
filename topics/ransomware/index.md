# Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a system or its data until a sum of money is paid. The victim's data is encrypted, making it inaccessible, and a ransom message is displayed demanding payment in exchange for a decryption key.

Ransomware attacks can be delivered via various methods, such as phishing emails, malvertising, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once a system is infected, the ransomware starts encrypting the data files, including documents, photos, videos, and more. The victim is then presented with a message that demands payment in exchange for the decryption key needed to unlock their data.

The payment is typically demanded in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, which is difficult to trace. However, even if the victim pays the ransom, there is no guarantee that the attacker will provide the decryption key, or that the key will work to unlock the encrypted data.

Ransomware attacks can cause significant damage to individuals and organizations, resulting in the loss of valuable data and financial losses due to the cost of paying the ransom and the expenses associated with recovering from the attack. It is essential to have robust security measures in place to prevent ransomware attacks, such as regularly backing up data, keeping software up-to-date, and using anti-virus software and firewalls.
