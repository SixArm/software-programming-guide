# Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a standard markup language used to create web pages and web applications. It is the foundation of web development and is used to structure content on the web. HTML allows developers to define the structure and content of a web page using tags, attributes, and elements.

HTML was first developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The language has since gone through multiple revisions, with HTML5 being the most recent and widely used version. HTML5 was released in 2014 and introduced a variety of new features including video and audio support, form controls, and more.

HTML is a declarative language, meaning that it describes the structure and content of a document, rather than specifying how that document should be displayed. Web browsers use the HTML code to render web pages, interpreting the tags and elements to determine how the page should be displayed to the user. HTML can be used in combination with other technologies like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create rich, interactive web experiences.

HTML tags are used to define elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and some tags require attributes to be specified in order to define their properties or behavior. For example, the image tag requires the "src" attribute to specify the location of the image file.

HTML documents are structured using a hierarchy of elements, with the "html" tag at the top level. Within the "html" tag, the "head" tag is used to define metadata about the page, such as the title and author, while the "body" tag contains the actual content of the page. Additional tags can be used to define subsections of the page, such as headers and footers.
