# Rapid Application Development (RAD)

Rapid Application Development (RAD) is an iterative software development methodology that focuses on building software quickly and efficiently. The RAD model emphasizes prototyping and user feedback to create software that meets user needs and requirements.

The RAD model consists of four phases:

1. Requirements Planning phase: the project team identifies the key requirements and scope of the project. This includes identifying user needs and requirements, as well as any technical requirements that need to be met. The project team also defines the overall project plan, including timelines and milestones.

2. User Design phase: focuses on creating a working prototype of the software. This involves creating mockups and wireframes of the user interface, as well as designing the database schema and data models. User feedback is critical during this phase to ensure that the software meets the needs of the end users.

3. Construction phase: is where the actual coding and development of the software takes place. Developers work on building the software using the design specifications from the previous phase. This phase is often broken down into smaller, iterative cycles, allowing the team to test and refine the software as they go.

4. Cutover phase: involves deploying the software to production and transitioning users to the new system. This includes training users, migrating data, and ensuring that the software is running smoothly.

The RAD methodology emphasizes speed and flexibility in software development. It allows teams to quickly build and test software prototypes, while also ensuring that user needs and requirements are met. The RAD model can be particularly useful in situations where requirements are changing rapidly, or where a quick turnaround is needed to get software to market.
