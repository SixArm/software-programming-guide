# Waterfall software development methodology

Waterfall software development methodology is a linear, sequential approach to software development. It follows a top-down approach, where each phase of the software development cycle is completed before moving on to the next phase. The five phases in the Waterfall methodology are:

1. Requirements gathering and analysis: This phase involves collecting requirements and analyzing them to create a detailed software requirement specification (SRS) document.

2. Design: In this phase, the software architecture and design are created based on the SRS document. The design phase includes creating system and software design specifications.

3. Implementation: In this phase, the software is developed based on the design and specification documents.

4. Testing: This phase involves testing the software for bugs, defects, and other issues. Various testing methodologies such as functional testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing are used to ensure that the software meets the requirements.

5. Maintenance: The final phase involves maintaining the software, which includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and updating the software to meet new requirements.

The Waterfall model is a simple and easy-to-understand methodology. It is suitable for projects where the requirements are well understood and not likely to change. It is also best suited for small projects with a defined scope, clear objectives, and fixed timelines. However, the Waterfall model has some limitations. It can be inflexible and difficult to accommodate changes in requirements, and it can result in a long wait before the final product is delivered.
