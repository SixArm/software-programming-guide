# Topic branch

In Git, a topic branch is a separate branch of code that is used to isolate changes related to a specific feature or task. This is useful because it allows developers to work on different features or tasks independently, without interfering with each other's work. Topic branches are also useful for managing code reviews and maintaining a clear history of changes made to the codebase.

The basic workflow for working with topic branches is as follows:

* Create a new branch: When you want to work on a new feature or task, you create a new branch from the main branch of the codebase.

* Make changes: Edit the codebase as you wish. These changes are isolated to your topic branch and will not affect the main branch or any other topic branches.

* Review changes: Ask other developers to review your changes, to provide feedback or comments.

* Merge changes: Merge your branch's chances into the main branch. This updates the codebase with your changes and makes them available to other developers.

Git provides many commands for working with topic branches, such asâ€¦

* `git branch`: Lists all branches in the codebase.

* `git checkout`: Switches to a different branch.

* `git merge`: Merges changes from one branch into another.
