# Coordinated disclosure

Coordinated disclosure is a process of reporting security vulnerabilities or bugs found in systems to the systems' owners. Coordinated disclosure is important because it allows security vulnerabilities to be addressed and fixed before they can be exploited by malicious actors. This helps protect users, data, and systems from potential harm.

**Key aspects:**

1. Discovery: The first step is discovering a security vulnerability or bug. For example, security researchers can identify potential vulnerabilities in software or hardware systems.

2. Notification: The discoverer notifies the owner of the product or system. This is done privately and securely to prevent the vulnerability from being known to others.

3. Verification: The owner verifies the issue and determines its severity. This can involve testing the system and analyzing the potential impact of the vulnerability on users.

4. Fix and Release: The owner develops a patch or fix for the issue, then releases it to users as soon as possible, along with instructions on how to install and use it.

5. Disclosure: After the fix, the discoverer and owner can disclose the issue publicly. This allows other people to learn about issue, and take steps to protect themselves from similar issues in the future.
