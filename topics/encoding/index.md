# Encoding

Encoding is the process of converting information from one form to another, such that it can be transmitted, stored, or processed effectively. Encoding is an essential aspect of communication and is used in a wide range of fields, including computer science, digital communication, telecommunications, and multimedia. There are various encoding techniques used in computer science, including character encoding, binary encoding, and image encoding.

Character encoding is the process of representing a set of characters or symbols in a digital format. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and Unicode are two common character encoding standards used in computing. ASCII uses 7-bit code to represent 128 characters, while Unicode uses a 16-bit or 32-bit code to represent more than 100,000 characters, including various scripts, languages, and symbols.

Binary encoding is the process of converting information into a binary format, consisting of only two symbols: 0 and 1. Binary encoding is commonly used in computer memory and data storage, where information is stored as a sequence of binary digits.

Image encoding is the process of representing an image in a digital format, such that it can be stored, transmitted, or displayed on a digital device. There are various image encoding techniques used in computer graphics, including JPEG, GIF, and PNG. These image encoding standards use different algorithms to compress and store images in a digital format, while minimizing the loss of image quality.
