# Error correction algorithms 

Error correction algorithms are techniques used in data systems to correct errors that may occur due to various factors such as noise in transmission, hardware faults, or data corruption. 

Some common ones:

* Hamming codes are linear error-correcting codes that add extra bits to the data to create redundancy, to correct single-bit errors and detect two-bit errors.

* Reed-Solomon codes are widely used in data storage and digital communication systems. They can correct multiple errors in a block of data. 

* Turbo Codes and LDPC Codes are used in advanced communication systems, such as 4G and 5G mobile networks and satellite communication. They offer excellent error correction capabilities.

* Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes can correct multiple errors. They are used in applications like data storage and satellite communication.

* Convolutional codes are used in digital communication systems. They can correct errors by processing data in a sliding window, making them suitable for applications with burst errors.

* Turbo codes are a class of efficient iteratively decoded error-correcting codes used in applications like mobile and satellite communication.

* Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are widely used in modern digital communication systems, including Wi-Fi and 4G/5G networks.
