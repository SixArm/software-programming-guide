# Database paradigms

Database paradigms refer to the theoretical framework and concepts that govern how data is organized, stored, and accessed in a database management system (DBMS). There are several database paradigms, each with its own set of rules, models, and methods for managing data. Some of the commonly used database paradigms are:

* Relational database: Data is in tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. Relationships among tables is established through primary keys and foreign keys. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manipulate data.

* Document-oriented database: Data is in documents, such as using JSON or XML. This paradigm is used for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts, blogs, and articles.

* Object-oriented database: Data is in objects, which can contain properties, methods, and relationships with other objects. This paradigm is used to manage complex data structures, such as multimedia content and geographic information.

* Graph database: Data is in nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between them. This paradigm is used for managing complex, interconnected data, such as social networks and recommendation systems.

* Vector database: TODO

* Ledger database: TODO

* Time-series database: TODO
