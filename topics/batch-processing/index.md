# Batch processing

Batch processing is a method of processing data in which a group of transactions is collected, stored, and processed all at once as a single batch. This is in contrast to real-time processing, where data is processed as it is received. Batch processing can be used to process large volumes of data efficiently and cost-effectively.

The process of batch processing involves several steps. First, data is collected and stored in a temporary location, such as a file or database table. Then, the data is transformed and processed according to a set of predefined rules or procedures. This may include sorting, filtering, and aggregating the data to create summary reports or other outputs. Finally, the processed data is loaded into a final destination, such as a database or data warehouse.

Batch processing is commonly used in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, and retail. For example, banks may use batch processing to process large volumes of transactions at the end of each day, while healthcare providers may use it to analyze patient data for research purposes. Batch processing is also commonly used in data warehousing, where large volumes of data must be processed and stored for later analysis.

One of the benefits of batch processing is that it can be highly automated, which can reduce the need for manual intervention and increase efficiency. However, because batch processing occurs in batches, it may not be suitable for applications that require real-time data processing and immediate feedback.
