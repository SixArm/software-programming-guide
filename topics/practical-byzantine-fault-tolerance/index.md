# Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a consensus algorithm designed to achieve fault tolerance and consensus in distributed systems, even in the presence of Byzantine faults. Byzantine faults refer to arbitrary and malicious behavior by nodes in a distributed network, such as sending contradictory messages, failing to respond, or intentionally trying to disrupt the network's operation.

**Key aspects:**

Asynchronous Network: PBFT operates in an asynchronous network environment, meaning there are no assumptions made about message delivery times or message ordering.

Three-Phase Protocol: Phase 1 is Propose: The primary (leader) node proposes a sequence of transactions in a block and broadcasts the proposal to all other nodes. Phase 2 is Prepare: Upon receiving the proposal, the other nodes validate it and respond with a "prepare" message, indicating their agreement with the proposed block. Phase 3 is Commit: Once a node has received a sufficient number of prepare messages from other nodes, it broadcasts a "commit" message, indicating that the proposed block is ready to be added.

Quorum System: PBFT uses a quorum system, meaning a certain number of nodes must agree (reach a consensus) on a particular phase before proceeding to the next phase. This ensures that the network progresses only when a significant number of nodes are in agreement.

Fault Tolerance: PBFT can tolerate up to one-third of the total nodes being Byzantine faulty. As long as at least two-thirds of the nodes are honest and in agreement, the network can reach consensus.

View Change: If the primary node (leader) becomes faulty or unavailable, the network can initiate a view change to select a new primary node to continue the consensus process.
