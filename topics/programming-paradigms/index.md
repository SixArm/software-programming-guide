# Programming paradigms

Programming paradigms refer to the approaches or methodologies used in software development. Each paradigm is a way of solving problems in programming.

Some kindsâ€¦

Imperative Programming: Tell the system what to do and how to do it, step by step. Focus on the sequencing of the instructions.

Procedural Programming: Use procedures to solve problems. Focus on the use of procedures to manipulate data, change state, and mutate data.

Declarative Programming: Tell the system what it should accomplish, rather than how it should accomplish it. Focus on constraints, logic, and rules.

Functional Programming: Use functions to solve problems, to manipulate data, and to avoid changing state.

Object-Oriented Programming: Use of objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to represent data and its operations.

Aspect-Oriented Programming: Modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management.

Message-Oriented Programming: coordinate by sending/receiving messages, with queues, inboxes, actors, and distributed resources.

Event-Driven Programming: Respond to user input or system events, to execute specific code when an event is triggered.

Logic Programming: Create rules and constraints that describe the problem, then use reasoning to determine the best solution.

Actor Programming: Create independent agents that can each work independently, or in collaboration, to solve problems.
