# Usability testing

Usability testing is a method used to evaluate the usability and user-friendliness of a product, system, or interface by observing users as they interact with it. The primary goal of usability testing is to identify any usability issues, obstacles, or areas for improvement to enhance the overall user experience.

The process of usability testing typically involves the following steps: define objectives, plan  scenarios, recruit participants, conduct tests, analyze findings, create recommendations, and iterate.

Benefits includeâ€¦

Enhanced User Experience: By addressing usability issues and improving the user interface, usability testing contributes to a better overall user experience. It can lead to increased user satisfaction, improved task completion rates, and reduced user errors.

Issue Identification: Usability testing uncovers usability issues and obstacles that may not be apparent during the development process. It provides valuable insights into how users actually interact with the product and highlights areas where improvements are needed.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Usability testing provides empirical data and user feedback that can inform design decisions and guide product improvements. It helps prioritize design changes based on actual user needs and preferences.

Cost and Time Savings: Identifying and addressing usability issues early in the development process can save time and resources by avoiding costly redesigns and updates later on. Usability testing helps catch and address issues before they become major problems.
