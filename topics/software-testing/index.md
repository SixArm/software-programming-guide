# Software testing

Software testing is the process of verifying and validating software applications or systems to ensure that they function as expected and meet the requirements of the end-users. Testing is an essential part of software development, as it helps identify defects, bugs, and other issues that could negatively impact the performance, security, and functionality of the software.

Software testing can be manual or automated. Manual testing involves a person executing test cases and verifying the results. Automated testing involves using software tools to run testing programs.

There are many different types of software testing such asâ€¦

Unit testing: This is the process of testing individual units or components of the software to ensure that they function as expected.

Integration testing: This is the process of testing how individual components of the software work together to ensure that the overall system functions as expected.

Acceptance testing: This is the process of testing the software to ensure that it meets the expectations of the end-users and that it is ready for deployment.

Regression testing: This is the process of testing the software after changes have been made to ensure that no new bugs or issues have been introduced.

Performance testing: This is the process of testing the software's performance under different conditions, such as high traffic or heavy load, to ensure that it performs well under these conditions.

Security testing: This is the process of testing the software's security to ensure that it is secure and protected against potential security threats.
