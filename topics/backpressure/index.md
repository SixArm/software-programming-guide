# Backpressure

Backpressure is a flow control mechanism used in computer software systems to prevent overload and ensure efficient operation. It is typically used in distributed systems or message-based systems where different components or services communicate with each other over a network.

The concept of backpressure is based on the idea of regulating the flow of messages or requests to prevent congestion or overload. When a system receives more requests than it can handle, it can become overloaded and unresponsive, which can result in failures or reduced performance. Backpressure helps to avoid this by controlling the rate of incoming requests, so that the system can process them at a pace that it can handle.

Backpressure can be implemented in different ways depending on the system architecture and the type of messages or requests being processed. Some common techniques include:

* Queue size: In this approach, a fixed-size buffer or queue is used to hold incoming requests. If the queue becomes full, backpressure is applied to prevent further requests from being accepted until there is available space in the queue.

* Flow control: In this approach, a component or service can signal to its upstream sender to slow down the rate of requests being sent. The sender can then adjust its rate accordingly to avoid congestion.

* Circuit breaker: In this approach, a component can detect when downstream services are unavailable or unresponsive, and temporarily stop sending requests to those services. This helps to prevent further overload and allows the system to recover.

Backpressure is an important technique for maintaining system stability and preventing overload in distributed or message-based systems. By regulating the flow of requests and messages, it helps to ensure that the system can operate efficiently and reliably.
