# String search algorithms

String search algorithms, also known as string matching algorithms, are used to find the occurrences of a substring (or pattern) within a longer text (or main string). These algorithms have applications in various fields, including text processing, data analysis, and information retrieval.

Several well-known string search algorithms includeâ€¦

Brute Force (Naive) String Search: The simplest method that checks for a pattern match at each possible starting position in the text. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*m), where "n" is the length of the text and "m" is the length of the pattern.

Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm: An efficient string search algorithm that preprocesses the pattern to determine the maximum length of the proper suffix that matches a proper prefix. This information is used to avoid unnecessary comparisons during string searching, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n+m).

Boyer-Moore Algorithm: A fast and practical string search algorithm that uses two heuristic rules, the bad character rule and the good suffix rule, to skip comparisons and achieve sublinear time complexity in practice.

Rabin-Karp Algorithm: A hash-based string matching algorithm that uses rolling hashes to compare substrings of the text with the pattern. It has an average-case linear time complexity but may have worst-case performance issues.

Aho-Corasick Algorithm: A string search algorithm that is particularly efficient for searching multiple patterns simultaneously. It builds a finite automaton that recognizes all the patterns and processes the text in a single pass.

Z-Algorithm: A linear time string matching algorithm that computes the Z-array, which represents the longest substring starting from each position that matches the beginning of the text. It can be used to search for multiple patterns in a text efficiently.

Trie Data Structure: A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings. It is commonly used for dictionary search and autocomplete functionality.

Regular Expressions (Regex): A powerful way to define search patterns for text using a formal language. Regex engines are available in many programming languages and are widely used for text pattern matching.

These algorithms have different trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and suitability for various types of pattern matching tasks. The choice of which algorithm to use depends on the specific requirements of your application, the characteristics of the text and patterns, and the computational resources available.
