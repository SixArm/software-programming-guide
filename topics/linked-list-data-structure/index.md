# Linked list data structure

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science used for organizing and managing a collection of elements, often referred to as nodes. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists use pointers to connect the elements together. Each node contains both the data it holds and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Linked lists are used in various scenarios, such as implementing data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables, as well as for memory management in programming languages. They provide valuable solutions when dynamic allocation and efficient insertions or deletions are essential.

Linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions at any position, but they don't offer constant-time random access like arrays. Linked lists are commonly used when elements need to be added or removed frequently, or when the size of the list may change dynamically.

A singly linked list has each node point to the next node in the sequence. A doubly linked list has each node points to both the next node and the previous node. A circular linked list has the last node point to the first node, forming a loop.

Key operationsâ€¦

Insert: Add a new node to the list, either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.

Delete: Remove a node from the list by adjusting pointers to bypass the node.

Traverse: Iterate through the list to access or manipulate its elements.

Search: Locate a specific element within the list.
