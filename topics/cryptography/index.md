# Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of securing communication from third-party intervention. The purpose of cryptography is to provide privacy, confidentiality, and integrity to data. Cryptography plays a crucial role in securing of digital communication and data storage.

Cryptography uses a set of algorithms to convert plaintext (unencrypted data) into ciphertext (encrypted data) and vice versa. The process of encryption involves using a secret key to convert plaintext data into ciphertext data, which is unreadable and meaningless to anyone without the key. Similarly, decryption is the process of using the secret key to convert the ciphertext back into the original plaintext.

There are two main types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encryption and decryption. The key is kept secret by the communicating parties, and anyone without the key cannot read the message. Examples of algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), and Blowfish.

Asymmetric cryptography uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key is shared with everyone; the private key is kept secret by the owner. The public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt it. Examples of asymmetric cryptography algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

Cryptography is used to protect sensitive data such as passwords, financial transactions, and medical records. Cryptography is also used in digital signatures, which provide non-repudiation and authenticity to digital documents.

However, cryptography can still be vulnerable to attacks such as brute force attacks, side-channel attacks, and quantum attacks.
