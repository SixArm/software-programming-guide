# Memory management

Memory management is a critical component of modern computer systems and operating systems. It involves the management of a computer's primary memory (RAM) and secondary memory (e.g., hard drives) to ensure efficient, reliable, and secure storage and retrieval of data and program code. Memory management is essential for optimizing the use of available memory resources and preventing issues like memory leaks and data corruption.

Computer systems typically have multiple levels of memory, organized in a hierarchy. Registers and cache memory provide the fastest access, followed by RAM (main memory), and secondary storage (e.g., hard drives). Effective memory management involves moving data between these levels efficiently.

Memory allocation is the process of setting aside portions of memory for specific purposes. It includes dynamic allocation (at runtime) and static allocation (fixed memory allocation at compile time). Dynamic memory allocation is commonly used to allocate memory for data structures and objects.

Memory deallocation involves releasing memory that is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks. In languages like C and C++, developers are responsible for explicitly deallocating memory. In languages with garbage collection, the system automatically reclaims memory.

Memory management includes mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access, buffer overflows, and other security vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches.

Memory fragmentation, both internal (within allocated blocks) and external (between allocated and free blocks), can lead to inefficient memory usage. Techniques like compaction (reorganizing memory) and buddy systems are used to address fragmentation.

Memory management may involve sharing memory among processes for communication or memory-mapped files for efficient I/O operations.

Memory management may involve leak detection and prevention, which can occur when allocated memory is not properly deallocated.
