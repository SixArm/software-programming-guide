# Penetration testing

Penetration testing (pen testing) is a method used to evaluate the security of computer systems or networks by simulating an attack on them.

Penetration testing involves the use of various tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities in a system. This can include scanning for open ports, attempting to exploit known vulnerabilities, and using social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

The goal of a penetration test is to identify weaknesses in a system's defenses before an attacker can exploit them. This allows organizations to identify and mitigate security risks before they can be exploited.

There are two main types of penetration testing: black box and white box. Black box testing is conducted with no prior knowledge of the system's internals. White box testing is conducted with full knowledge of the system's internals.

The penetration testing process typically involves the following steps:

* Planning and reconnaissance: In this phase, the tester collects information about the target system, such as its architecture, network topology, and potential vulnerabilities.

* Scanning: The tester uses various tools to scan the system for open ports, network services, and vulnerabilities.

* Gaining access: Once vulnerabilities have been identified, the tester attempts to exploit them to gain access to the system.

* Maintaining access: If the tester is successful in gaining access, they will attempt to maintain their access to the system to gather further information and access additional resources.

* Analysis and reporting: After the test is complete, the tester will analyze the results and prepare a report outlining any vulnerabilities that were identified and recommendations for remediation.
