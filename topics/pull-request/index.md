# Pull request (PR)

A pull request (PR) in Git is a feature that allows developers to propose changes to a codebase hosted on a remote repository. The PR serves as a way for developers to review and discuss proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch of the codebase.

The basic workflow of a pull request is as follows:

* A developer forks the repository they want to contribute to.

* The developer creates a new branch in their forked repository to make their changes.

* Once the changes are complete, the developer creates a pull request to merge their changes into the original repository.

* Other developers can review the changes and provide feedback or comments on the PR.

* If the changes are approved, the PR is merged into the main branch of the original repository.

* If there are conflicts or issues with the changes, the developer can make updates and continue the review process until the changes are approved.

Using pull requests can provide benefits including: improving collaboration, facilitating code reviews, providing a change log, and enabling pull-request testing.

In addition to the basic workflow, pull requests can also include additional features such as automated tests, code linting, and continuous integration, which can help improve the overall quality and consistency of the codebase.
