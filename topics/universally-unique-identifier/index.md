# Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. It is a 128-bit identifier used to uniquely identify information without the need for centralized coordination. UUIDs are designed to be globally unique, meaning the probability of two UUIDs being the same is exceedingly low, even when generated by different systems or at different times.

A UUID is typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string, consisting of five groups of hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens, like this: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000". UUIDs can be generated using various algorithms, such as Version 1 (time-based), Version 4 (random) UUID, and Version 5 (name-based).

Due to their uniqueness, UUIDs are valuable in scenarios where there is a need to avoid conflicts, maintain data integrity, and ensure reliable identification across distributed systems.

**Some uses:**

* **Database Primary Keys:** UUIDs can be used as primary keys for database records instead of auto-incrementing integers. This allows for distributed database systems without the risk of key collisions.

* **Distributed Systems:** In distributed systems, UUIDs help ensure that each node can generate unique identifiers for the data it manages without relying on a centralized authority.

* **Session Management:** UUIDs can be used to identify and manage user sessions on web applications.

* **Asynchronous Messaging:** In message queues or event-based systems, UUIDs can uniquely identify messages, ensuring no duplication or data loss.

* **Security and Privacy:** UUIDs can be used to create unique, hard-to-guess identifiers for user accounts, access tokens, and other sensitive information.
