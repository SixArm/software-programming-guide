# Mean time to repair (MTTR)

Mean time to repair (MTTR) is a metric used to measure the average time it takes to repair a failed system or equipment and restore it to normal operating conditions. MTTR is an important measure for evaluating the reliability of a system or equipment and is commonly used in maintenance management.

MTTR is calculated by dividing the total downtime by the number of failures during that period. For example, if a system has been down for a total of 8 hours due to two failures during a month, the MTTR would be 4 hours (8 hours total downtime / 2 failures = 4 hours).

MTTR is often used in conjunction with Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), which measures the average time between failures. Together, these two metrics provide valuable insights into the reliability of a system and help to identify areas for improvement in the maintenance process.

A low MTTR indicates that a system or equipment can be repaired quickly and efficiently, minimizing the impact of failures on productivity and performance. In contrast, a high MTTR suggests that the system or equipment is unreliable and that the repair process is inefficient, leading to prolonged downtime and lost productivity.

MTTR is an important metric in many industries, including manufacturing, transportation, and information technology, where downtime can have a significant impact on productivity and profitability. By monitoring and optimizing MTTR, organizations can improve the reliability and performance of their systems and equipment and minimize the impact of failures on their operations.
