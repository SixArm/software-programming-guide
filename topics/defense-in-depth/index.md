# Defense in depth

Defense in depth is a concept in software security that involves implementing multiple layers of security measures to protect against potential attacks. The goal of defense in depth is to create multiple barriers that an attacker would need to penetrate in order to reach the valuable data or assets of the system. By creating multiple layers of security, the system can continue to function even if one or more layers are compromised.

There are various layers that can be implementedâ€¦

Perimeter security: This is the first line of defense and includes measures such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems that are designed to prevent unauthorized access from outside the network.

Application security: This layer includes measures such as input validation and error handling that are designed to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the application code.

Access control: This layer involves implementing policies and procedures to control who has access to the system and what level of access they have.

Data encryption: This layer involves encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.

Monitoring and response: This layer involves monitoring the system for suspicious activity and responding quickly to any potential threats.
