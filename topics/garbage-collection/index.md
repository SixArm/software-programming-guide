# Garbage collection

Garbage collection is a critical aspect of memory management in computer science. It refers to the automatic process of identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by a program. The goal is to free up memory resources, prevent memory leaks, and ensure efficient utilization of available memory.

**Key aspects:**

* **Memory Allocation and Deallocation**: In many programming languages, memory is allocated for data dynamically at runtime. When data is no longer needed, its memory should be deallocated.

* **Manual Memory Management**: In languages like C and C++, developers are responsible for manually allocating and deallocating memory using functions like malloc and free. This manual approach is error-prone.

* **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Many modern programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript, employ automatic garbage collection; the language runtime or virtual machine automatically identifies and reclaims unused memory.

* **Reachability Analysis**: Garbage collectors typically use reachability analysis to determine which objects are still accessible by the program. Objects that are not reachable are considered garbage.

* **Algorithms**: Various garbage collection algorithms exist, including reference counting, mark-and-sweep, generational, and copying collectors. Each has its strengths and weaknesses.

* **Triggers**: Garbage collection can be triggered based on factors like memory pressure, the number of allocated objects, or time intervals.

* **Overhead**: Garbage collection comes with a performance cost, including increased runtime overhead and occasionally unpredictable pauses.
