# Security testing

Security testing is a process of evaluating the security of a software system or application by testing its security features, functions, and configurations. The primary objective of security testing is to identify and mitigate potential security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.

Security testing can involve different typesâ€¦

Vulnerability testing: This testing technique is used to identify vulnerabilities in a software system or application. It involves scanning the system for known vulnerabilities and security holes.

Penetration testing: This testing technique involves simulating an attack on the system or application to identify potential vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of existing security measures.

Authentication testing: This testing technique is used to verify the authentication mechanism of the system or application. It involves testing the strength of passwords, encryption techniques, and other authentication methods.

Authorization testing: This testing technique is used to verify the access control mechanism of the system or application. It involves testing the system's ability to restrict access to authorized users.

Encryption testing: This testing technique is used to verify the effectiveness of encryption algorithms and keys used to protect sensitive data.

Security configuration testing: This testing technique is used to test the system's security configuration, including network settings, user access controls, and system updates.
