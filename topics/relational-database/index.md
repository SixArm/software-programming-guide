# Relational database

A relational database is a type of database that stores data in a structured manner, with data organized into tables that are related to each other based on common fields. It uses a set of tables to store data, where each table has a set of columns and each row contains a single record.

Key componentsâ€¦

* Tables: The data in a relational database is organized into tables, with each table containing a collection of related data. Each table consists of rows and columns, with each row representing a single record and each column representing a specific piece of information about the record.

* Primary keys: Each table in a relational database has a primary key, which is a unique identifier for each record in the table. The primary key is used to ensure that each record in the table can be identified and retrieved easily.

* Relationships: The tables in a relational database are related to each other through common fields. These relationships are established using foreign keys, which are fields in one table that refer to the primary key in another table.

* Constraints: Relational databases use constraints to enforce rules and ensure data integrity. Constraints can be used to enforce rules such as requiring a field to be unique, limiting the values that can be entered into a field, or requiring a field to be non-null.

Some popular relational database management systems include PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
