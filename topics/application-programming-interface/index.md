# Application Programming Interface (API)

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines what operations can be performed, and how developers can access the functionality of the software system or service.

APIs can be classified into different types based on their purposeâ€¦

Web APIs: These are for web development, and typically use web protocols such as HTTP and conventions such as RESTful to communicate. Web APIs allow developers to access and manipulate resources (data, services, or functionalities) provided by a web server. They typically return responses in formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

Library APIs: These provide functions and procedures that developers can use to interact with specific libraries or software frameworks. These are often bundled with software development kits (SDKs) and allow developers to access pre-built code and features. Library APIs provide an abstraction layer, simplifying complex operations and allowing developers to leverage existing code..

Operating System APIs: These provide a way for applications to interact with the underlying operating system. These offer functions and services to access hardware devices, file systems, network resources, process management, and other system-level operations. These APIs are specific to the operating system and enable developers to create applications that utilize the capabilities of the underlying platform.

Database APIs: Database APIs provide interfaces for applications to interact with databases. They define methods and operations such as to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from the database. Database APIs are essential for integrating applications with database systems and accessing database data efficiently.
