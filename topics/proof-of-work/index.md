# Proof-of-work (PoW)

Proof-of-work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The PoW algorithm requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and earn rewards for their efforts.

In PoW, miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle by using their computing power to perform a series of calculations. The first miner to solve the puzzle earns the right to add a new block to the blockchain and receive a reward in the form of newly minted cryptocurrency.

The difficulty of the puzzle is adjusted regularly to ensure that new blocks are added to the blockchain at a consistent rate. This difficulty adjustment is designed to ensure that the blockchain network remains secure and that miners cannot overpower the network by using too much computing power.

One of the main advantages of PoW is that it is resistant to attacks because it requires a significant amount of computational power to solve the puzzles. This means that an attacker would need to control a large percentage of the network's computing power to successfully launch an attack, which is known as a 51% attack.

However, PoW is also known for its high energy consumption due to the need for miners to use large amounts of electricity to power their computers. This has led to criticism from some environmental groups and calls for more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms to be developed.

Despite its drawbacks, PoW remains one of the most widely used consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. Its popularity is due in part to its proven track record of security and resistance to attacks, as well as its ability to incentivize miners to participate in the network and help maintain its integrity.
