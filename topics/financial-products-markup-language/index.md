# Financial Products Markup Language (FPML)

Financial Products Markup Language (FPML) is an XML-based standard designed to describe complex financial products and the business processes that are involved in trading them. It is used to facilitate communication between different financial institutions and to provide a common standard for the representation of financial products.

FPML was developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) as a response to the need for a standard way of communicating complex financial products across different platforms and systems. FPML covers a wide range of financial products, including interest rate swaps, credit derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, equity derivatives, and commodities.

The language is used by financial institutions, including banks, hedge funds, and investment firms, to standardize the representation of financial products, which in turn enables the automation of trade capture, risk management, and trade confirmation processes. FPML provides a standardized way of representing financial contracts, including the terms and conditions of the contract, cash flows, events, and other relevant data.

FPML uses XML syntax to define the structure of financial products and business processes. It consists of a set of pre-defined tags, which represent different elements of a financial product, such as product type, trade date, settlement date, and payment frequency. FPML also allows for the customization of tags to meet specific business needs.
