# Resource Description Framework (RDF)

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard for representing and sharing information on the web. It is part of the Semantic Web framework and provides a structured format for describing resources, such as web pages, people, and products, in a way that can be understood by machines.

At its core, RDF is a way of describing information as a graph, where the nodes represent resources and the edges represent the relationships between them. Each resource is identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), which can be used to retrieve more information about the resource.

RDF provides a set of vocabulary terms, called RDF triples, that are used to describe resources and their relationships. These triples consist of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The subject is the resource being described, the predicate is the relationship between the subject and object, and the object is the resource or value that the relationship is describing.

RDF is often used in combination with other Semantic Web technologies, such as OWL (Web Ontology Language) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language), to create powerful applications for sharing and querying data on the web. It is also used by search engines to provide more relevant search results and by data providers to make their data more easily discoverable and usable.
