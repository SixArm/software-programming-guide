# Inheritance

Inheritance, in the context of computer science and object-oriented programming (OOP), is a fundamental concept that allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (i.e., data fields and methods) of another class. It's one of the core principles of OOP and is used to model relationships and create hierarchies among classes. 

Inheritance provides code reusability, extensibility, and a way to represent an "is-a" relationship between classes. For example, if you have a base class "Vehicle," you can create derived classes like "Car" and "Truck" that are both vehicles. The relationship is "Car is a Vehicle" and "Truck is a Vehicle."

Inheritance allows developers to reuse code by inheriting the attributes and methods of an existing class, rather than recreating them from scratch. This is a fundamental concept for promoting modular and efficient software development.

Subclasses can provide their own implementations of methods inherited from the superclass. This process is called method overriding. It allows subclasses to customize or extend the behavior of inherited methods.

In addition to inheriting from a base class, a class can also implement one or more interfaces, which define a contract specifying the methods that must be implemented. Interface inheritance allows classes to define multiple behaviors and is particularly useful for achieving polymorphism.

Inheritance, along with polymorphism, enables a single interface to represent different types of objects. This simplifies code and allows the same code to work with different objects that share a common base class or interface.

In some cases, composition (using objects of one class within another) may be a better choice than inheritance. Composition provides more flexibility and avoids the complexities and constraints of inheritance.
