# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto".

Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers around the world. The blockchain serves as a decentralized and secure database that keeps a record of all Bitcoin transactions.

The total number of Bitcoins that can exist is limited to 21 million, and the currency is created through a process called mining. Mining involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical equations that validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins for their efforts.

Bitcoin's value is determined by market demand and supply. Its price has experienced significant volatility over the years, reaching an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April 2021. Bitcoin has been criticized for its association with illegal activities like money laundering and the purchase of illegal goods on the dark web. However, it has also been lauded for its potential as a store of value and a means of exchange that operates independently of traditional financial systems.
