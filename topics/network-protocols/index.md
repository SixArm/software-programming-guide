# Network protocols

Network protocols are a set of rules and procedures that govern the communication between different devices. These protocols define how devices communicate with each other, how data is transmitted and received, and how errors are handled.

Some types of network protocolsâ€¦

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP): TCP/IP is the most widely used protocol for networking. It is a suite of protocols that includes several different protocols for different purposes, including TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP/IP is used to connect devices over the internet.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting web pages and other content over the internet. It allows web browsers to request web pages from servers and receive the requested pages in return.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP is a protocol used for transferring files between computers. It allows users to upload and download files to and from remote servers.
