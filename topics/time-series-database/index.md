# Time-series database

A time-series database (TSDB) is a type of database designed to handle and manage time-series data. Time-series data is a sequence of data points that are indexed by time. This type of data is commonly generated by sensors, IoT devices, and other types of systems that generate data over time.

A time-series database is designed to handle the unique characteristics of time-series data, such as the requirement to quickly and efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data points, as well as to perform time-based queries and analysis. These databases are optimized for data that is constantly being appended with new data points, rather than modified or deleted.

Some of the key features of a time-series database include:

* Efficient storage and retrieval: Time-series databases are designed to store and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently, using compression and indexing techniques that optimize performance.

* Time-based queries: A time-series database allows users to query data based on specific time intervals or time-based patterns. This is essential for analyzing trends and patterns over time.

* Stream processing: Many time-series databases can perform real-time stream processing of data, allowing for near-instantaneous analysis of streaming data.

* Aggregation and summarization: A time-series database can aggregate and summarize data at various levels of granularity, such as by minute, hour, or day, to make it easier to analyze large datasets.

Examples of time-series databases include InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, and OpenTSDB. These databases are commonly used in applications such as IoT, financial analytics, and log analysis, where the ability to store and query time-series data is critical for extracting insights and making data-driven decisions.
