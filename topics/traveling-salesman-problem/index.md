# Traveling salesman problem

The traveling salesman problem is a famous problem in computer science, operations research, and mathematics. It is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the shortest possible route that visits all given cities and returns to the starting city. The problem is named after the analogy with a traveling salesman who must visit a set of cities and return to the starting point, while minimizing the total distance traveled.

The problem is known to be NP-hard, which means that it is computationally difficult to solve for large input sizes. There are several variations of the TSP, including the Euclidean TSP (where the cities are points in a Euclidean space), the symmetric TSP (where the distance between two cities is the same in both directions), and the asymmetric TSP (where the distance between two cities may differ in both directions).

There are many algorithms and heuristics that have been developed to solve the TSP, including brute-force search, branch and bound, dynamic programming, nearest neighbor, and genetic algorithms. However, for large input sizes, exact algorithms become impractical, and heuristics are used to obtain near-optimal solutions.

The TSP has many applications, including route optimization for delivery and transportation services, circuit board drilling, DNA sequencing, and many more. The problem has also inspired research in other areas of computer science, such as approximation algorithms, graph theory, and computational geometry.
