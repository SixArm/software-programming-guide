# System testing

System testing is a type of software testing that is used to evaluate and verify the entire system's behavior and functionality as a whole. This testing technique ensures that all the software components work together correctly and satisfy the system requirements. The objective of system testing is to identify defects and ensure that the system operates as expected.

Typical types of tests performed during system testing includeâ€¦

Functional testing: Test the system's functions as per the requirements and specifications. It involves testing the inputs, processing, and outputs of the system.

Performance testing: Test the system's performance under normal and peak loads to ensure it meets the performance requirements.

Security testing: Test the system's security features and vulnerabilities to identify security loopholes and potential threats.

Usability testing: Test the system's user interface and user experience to ensure that the system is user-friendly and easy to use.

Compatibility testing: Test the system's compatibility with different hardware, software, and operating systems.

Regression testing: Test the system after making changes to ensure that existing functionality has not been affected.
