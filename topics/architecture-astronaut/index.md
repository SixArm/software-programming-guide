# Architecture astronaut

The term "architecture astronaut" is a colloquial and somewhat humorous expression used in software development to describe a person who overcomplicates software projects by focusing excessively on architectural design and patterns without a real need for such complexity. Instead, it's essential to strike a balance between appropriate architectural planning and agile development practices that prioritize delivering value to users efficiently.
