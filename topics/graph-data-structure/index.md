# Graph data structure

A graph data structure is a collection of nodes, also known as vertices, and the edges that connect them. It is a non-linear data structure that can be used to model relationships between entities. Graphs can be used to represent a wide variety of real-world scenarios, such as social networks, road networks, and the internet.

In a graph, each node represents an entity, such as a person or a city, and each edge represents a relationship between the entities, such as a friendship or a connection. The edges can be directed or undirected, meaning that they can be one-way or two-way connections.

There are two main types of graphs: directed and undirected. In a directed graph, the edges have a direction and represent a one-way relationship. For example, in a social network, a directed edge could represent a "follows" relationship, where one person follows another person but that person does not necessarily follow back. In an undirected graph, the edges do not have a direction and represent a two-way relationship. For example, in a road network, an undirected edge could represent a two-way road that connects two cities.

Graphs can also be weighted or unweighted. In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight or cost, which can represent a distance or a cost associated with the relationship. For example, in a road network, the weight of an edge could represent the distance between two cities. In an unweighted graph, all edges have the same weight.

There are several algorithms that can be used with graphs, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. These algorithms can be used to perform various operations on the graph, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes or finding all nodes connected to a given node.
