# Case-based reasoning (CBR)

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem-solving approach that is used to solve problems in a way that mimics the way humans tend to solve problems. It involves solving a new problem by comparing it to a set of previously solved problems and using the closest match as a model for the solution.

In CBR, a problem is solved by finding a similar problem that has already been solved and reusing its solution. The approach involves four stages:

* Retrieve: The system retrieves cases that are similar to the current problem. The similarity is based on the features of the problem and how they are represented.

* Reuse: The system adapts the solution of the retrieved case to fit the current problem.

* Revise: The system evaluates the solution and refines it if necessary.

* Retain: The system adds the new problem and its solution to the case base for future use.

The case base is the repository of solved problems that the system uses to solve new problems. It contains information about the problem, the solution, and the context in which the solution was used. The case base is typically organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and reuse of cases.

CBR has several advantages over other problem-solving approaches. One advantage is that it can handle problems where there is no explicit rule or formula for the solution. It can also adapt to changes in the problem domain over time by adding new cases to the case base.

CBR is used in a variety of applications, including medical diagnosis, fault diagnosis in engineering systems, financial decision making, and legal reasoning.
