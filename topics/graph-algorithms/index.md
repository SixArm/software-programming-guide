# Graph algorithms

Graph algorithms are a set of techniques used to solve problems that involve graphs, which are data structures composed of nodes and edges that connect them.

Some common ones:

* Breadth-First Search (BFS): This algorithm is used to traverse a graph, visiting all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level. It starts at a node and explores all the nodes at the same level before moving to the next level.

* Depth-First Search (DFS): This algorithm is similar to BFS, but it explores nodes by going as deep as possible before backtracking to explore other branches. It starts at a node and explores as far as possible before backtracking to explore other nodes.

* Dijkstra's Algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It works by assigning a tentative distance to each node and updating it as it explores the graph.

* Kruskal's Algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. It works by starting with the smallest edge and adding edges one by one, as long as they do not form a cycle.

* Prim's Algorithm: This algorithm is similar to Kruskal's algorithm but starts with a single node and adds edges that connect the node to the rest of the graph.

* Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. It works by updating a matrix of distances until it contains the shortest path between all pairs of nodes.
