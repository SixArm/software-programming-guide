# CAP theorem

The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, it is impossible to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

* Consistency: All nodes in the system see the same data at the same time.

* Availability: Every request to the system receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the data.

* Partition tolerance: The system continues to function even when network partitions occur.

The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, describes trade-offs that must be made in distributed systems.

In a distributed system, data is often replicated across multiple nodes to ensure availability and fault tolerance. However, as data is replicated across multiple nodes, it becomes difficult to maintain consistency across all nodes in real-time, especially in the face of network partitions or failures.

In practice, a distributed system can only achieve two out of three guarantees at any given time. Therefore, system designers must make trade-offs based on the specific requirements of their application.

For example, in a banking application, consistency is critical. Therefore, a distributed system may sacrifice availability in order to maintain strong consistency across all nodes. In contrast, a social media platform may prioritize availability over consistency, since it's more important to ensure that users can access the service even if they're seeing slightly stale data.

Understanding the CAP theorem can help developers and architects design distributed systems that meet the specific needs of their application, while ensuring that they're aware of the trade-offs involved in making those decisions.
