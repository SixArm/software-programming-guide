# Checked exceptions

In some programming languages, checked exceptions are exceptions that must be either handled or declared by a method or function. This is in contrast to unchecked exceptions, which do not require handling or declaration.

Checked exceptions are intended to represent exceptional conditions that could occur during the execution of a program, but which the program can reasonably be expected to handle. For example, if a program reads data from a file, there is a possibility that the file may not exist, or that the program may not have permission to read the file. In this case, a checked exception would be thrown to indicate the problem, and the program would need to either handle the exception or declare that it throws the exception and allow the calling code to handle it.

The requirement to handle or declare checked exceptions has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it can help ensure that programs handle potential problems in a consistent way, making them more robust and reliable. On the other hand, it can also result in code that is more verbose and harder to read, particularly when methods must declare many checked exceptions.

In recent years, some programming languages and frameworks have moved away from checked exceptions in favor of other approaches to error handling, such as unchecked exceptions, result types, or monads. However, checked exceptions remain a core feature of some programming languages, such as Java, and are widely used in the languages' many applications and libraries.
