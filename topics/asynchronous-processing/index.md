# Asynchronous processing (asynchronicity)

Asynchronous processing, also known as non-blocking processing, is a type of programming model in which a program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for a long-running operation to complete. In other words, asynchronous processing allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously without waiting for the completion of each individual task.

In traditional synchronous processing, a program waits for a long-running operation to complete before proceeding to the next task. This can cause performance issues and lead to unresponsive applications, especially in situations where a large number of users are making requests simultaneously.

Asynchronous processing solves this problem by allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a long-running operation to complete. For example, instead of blocking the entire application while waiting for a database query to complete, the program can initiate the query and then continue processing other requests until the query result is ready.

Asynchronous processing is commonly used in event-driven programming and is a key component of many modern programming frameworks and architectures. It is often used in web applications to handle a large number of concurrent requests and is a fundamental part of modern cloud computing platforms.

However, asynchronous processing also introduces some additional complexity, such as the need to manage multiple threads or processes, potential race conditions and deadlocks, and increased difficulty in debugging and testing. As a result, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous processing when designing and developing software applications.
