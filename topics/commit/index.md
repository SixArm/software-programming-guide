# Commit

In Git, a commit is a snapshot of changes to a project that has been saved to the repository. It is a fundamental concept in Git and is used to record and track changes to the codebase over time. Each commit represents a specific version of the codebase and includes a message that describes the changes made in that version.

Each commit contains a unique identifier hash that is automatically generated by Git, and can contain a message that describes the changes made in that commit. This message should be concise and descriptive, and should explain the reason for the changes made in the commit.

Commits create a complete record of changes made to the codebase over time. This enables developers to  track the evolution of the codebase, identify which changes were made and when, and revert to previous versions if necessary. Commits make it easier to collaborate with other developers by enabling them to see the changes made to the codebase and understand the reasoning behind those changes.

Git provides many commands to work with commits, such as:

* `git commit`: Create a new commit with the changes.

* `git log`: Display a list of commits made to the codebase.

* `git diff`: Show changes made between two commits.
