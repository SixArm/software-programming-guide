# Schema.org

Schema.org is a collaborative, community-driven effort to create a structured data markup schema that would help webmasters to provide more contextually relevant search results to users. It is a semantic markup language that aims to improve the way search engines display and understand content on web pages.

Schema.org uses shared vocabulary and schemas, known as "types," to markup web pages and describe the content of a webpage. This helps search engines to better understand the content on the page and provide more accurate and relevant search results. Schema.org is based on semantic web technologies and the schema vocabulary is implemented in the popular microdata, RDFa, and JSON-LD formats.

Schema.org provides a standard set of schemas that can be used to describe different types of content such as articles, reviews, products, events, organizations, and many more. These schemas are organized into categories such as Creative Works, Event, Organization, Person, Place, Product, and others.

Schema.org is widely used by webmasters, online publishers, and search engines to provide more accurate and contextually relevant search results to users. It is also used by social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to enrich their content and provide more contextually relevant content to their users.

Schema.org provides a standardized approach to structured data markup that helps webmasters to better describe their content to search engines and other web-based platforms, leading to improved search visibility, higher click-through rates, and ultimately better user engagement.

Schema.org was launched in June 2011 by Google, Yahoo!, and Bing.
