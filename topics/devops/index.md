# DevOps

DevOps, short for developer-operations, is a software development approach that seeks to break down traditional silos between developers and operations personnel, and create a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.

Core principlesâ€¦

Collaboration: Developers and operations teams work closely together throughout the software development lifecycle, from planning and design to deployment and maintenance.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: Code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, and automatically tested and validated, and shipped to end users.

Automation: DevOps relies on automation tools and processes to streamline software delivery, reduce errors, and increase efficiency.

Monitoring and Feedback: DevOps emphasizes the importance of monitoring software and gathering feedback from users to identify issues and make improvements.

Continuous Improvement: DevOps seeks to create a culture of continuous improvement, where teams learn from their experiences and use that knowledge to improve processes and practices.

The benefits of DevOps include faster time-to-market due to faster releases, increased efficiency, improved quality, and ultimately better user satisfaction.
