# Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique used in software development to speed up the execution of computationally expensive functions. It involves storing the results of a function call, so that subsequent calls with the same arguments can return the precomputed value instead of recomputing it again.

Memoization works by creating a lookup table (often a hash table or dictionary) that maps function arguments to their results. When a function is called, the memoization code checks if the function has already been called with the same arguments. If it has, the precomputed result is returned from the lookup table, rather than recalculating the result. If the function has not been called with those arguments before, the function is called as usual, and its result is stored in the lookup table for future use.

Memoization can be especially useful in situations where a function is called repeatedly with the same inputs, as it can significantly reduce the computation time. However, it may not always be appropriate or beneficial to use memoization. For example, memoization can increase memory usage and may not be effective for functions with a large number of input values, since the lookup table may become too large to store in memory.

In some cases, memoization can also introduce bugs if the function has side effects or mutable state. In such cases, memoization may need to be carefully implemented to ensure that the function behaves correctly.

Memoization can be implemented in a variety of programming languages, and there are also libraries and tools that provide memoization functionality.
