# Sort algorithms

Sort algorithms are a type of algorithm that put elements of a list in a specific order, such as numerical or alphabetical. There are many different types of sort algorithms, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the data being sorted and the resources available.

Here are some of the most common sort algorithms:

* Bubble Sort: This algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements in a list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, until the list is sorted.

* Selection Sort: This algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum element in a list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

* Insertion Sort: This algorithm works by taking elements from an unsorted list and inserting them into the correct position in a new, sorted list.

* Merge Sort: This algorithm divides an unsorted list into sub-lists, sorts the sub-lists, and then merges them back together to create a sorted list.

* Quick Sort: This algorithm works by partitioning an unsorted list into two smaller sub-lists, and then recursively sorting each sub-list.

* Heap Sort: This algorithm converts an unsorted list into a heap data structure, which is then converted back into a sorted list.

The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand, such as the size of the data set, the available memory, and the desired performance characteristics.
