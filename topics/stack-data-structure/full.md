# Stack data structure

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is used to store and manage a collection of elements, and its primary operations include adding elements (push) and removing elements (pop). The element that was most recently added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Imagine a physical stack of plates: you can add a new plate on top of the stack, and when you want to remove a plate, you take it from the top. Similarly, in a stack data structure, elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

Key operations of a stack:

* Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack. The new element becomes the top element.
* Pop: Removing the top element from the stack. The element that was below the top element becomes the new top.
* Peek (or Top): Viewing the top element without removing it.
* IsEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty.
* Size: Counting the number of elements in the stack.

Common use cases for stacks include managing function calls and recursion in programming, tracking states in algorithms, and implementing undo functionality in applications.

Example scenarios illustrating stack behavior:

* Function Calls: When a function is called, its context (parameters, variables, return address) is pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, its context is popped off the stack.

* Expression Evaluation: Stacks can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions by converting them from infix notation to postfix notation and then calculating the result.

* Backtracking: Stacks can be used to implement backtracking algorithms, such as depth-first search in graph traversal.

* Undo/Redo: In applications, a stack can store states of actions, allowing users to undo and redo actions.

Implementations of stacks can vary. In programming, stacks are often implemented using arrays or linked lists. Arrays provide constant-time access to elements, but their size may need to be managed. Linked lists provide dynamic sizing, but access time is linear in the worst case.

The stack data structure plays a crucial role in many algorithms and applications by providing an efficient and organized way to manage elements according to the LIFO principle.
