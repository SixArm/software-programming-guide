# Homomorphic encryption

Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic technique that allows computation on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first. In other words, it allows us to perform operations on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first, which preserves the confidentiality of the data.

The basic idea behind homomorphic encryption is to transform the data in such a way that mathematical operations can be performed on it while it is still in an encrypted form. This is achieved by using a special encryption algorithm that is designed to preserve the properties of the data that are relevant for the computations.

There are several different types of homomorphic encryption schemes, including fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), partially homomorphic encryption (PHE), and somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE). Fully homomorphic encryption allows arbitrary computations to be performed on the encrypted data, while partially homomorphic encryption only allows certain types of computations to be performed. Somewhat homomorphic encryption allows a limited set of computations to be performed, but with greater efficiency than fully homomorphic encryption.

Homomorphic encryption has a wide range of potential applications, particularly in the fields of cloud computing and data privacy. For example, it could be used to allow secure computation of data in the cloud, without the need to reveal the underlying data to the cloud provider. It could also be used to enable secure computation of data in other settings, such as in the context of medical research or financial analysis, where sensitive data needs to be kept confidential.

One of the challenges of homomorphic encryption is that it can be computationally expensive, particularly for fully homomorphic encryption schemes. As a result, current implementations of homomorphic encryption tend to be relatively slow, although ongoing research is focused on improving the efficiency of these techniques.
