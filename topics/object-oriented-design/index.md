# Object-oriented design (OOD)

Object-oriented design (OOD) is a popular software design approach used to build complex systems. It focuses on creating a modular design by breaking down a large system into smaller objects that have unique characteristics and interact with one another. In OOD, objects are created based on their attributes and behaviors, rather than the functionality they provide. These objects are typically modeled based on real-world concepts, which makes it easier to understand and design the system.

The key principles of OOD include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding an object's internal state from the outside world and exposing only the necessary information through well-defined interfaces. This helps prevent other parts of the system from modifying the object's internal state directly, which can lead to unwanted side effects.

Inheritance allows developers to create new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. This can save time and effort in creating new classes, as developers can reuse code from existing classes. Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms, allowing different objects to respond differently to the same message or method call.

OOD is often used to build large-scale systems with complex requirements, as it can help manage the complexity of the system by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable objects. It is also widely used in developing user interfaces, as it allows for easy reuse of components and makes it easier to manage complex interactions between the different parts of the user interface.
