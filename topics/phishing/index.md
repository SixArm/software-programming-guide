# Phishing

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker poses as a trustworthy entity to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal information. The attackers send emails or messages that appear to come from a legitimate source, such as a bank, online retailer, or even a colleague or friend, to deceive users into providing their sensitive information.

Phishing attacks can be conducted in several ways, including email, text messages, social media, and phone calls. The goal of the attacker is to trick the recipient into clicking on a malicious link or attachment that will take them to a fake website that looks like the real one. Once the user enters their information, it is captured by the attacker and used for fraudulent activities.

Phishing attacks are often accompanied by social engineering tactics such as urgency or fear. For example, the attacker might claim that the user's account has been compromised or that there is a security threat that requires immediate action. By using these tactics, the attacker hopes to make the user act quickly without thinking critically about the situation.

To protect against phishing attacks, it is important to be vigilant when receiving messages or emails from unknown sources. Look for signs of suspicious activity, such as misspellings, grammatical errors, and strange URLs. It is also important to verify the legitimacy of the sender before taking any action.

Organizations can also protect themselves against phishing attacks by implementing security measures such as two-factor authentication, spam filters, and employee training programs that educate employees on how to recognize and avoid phishing attacks.
