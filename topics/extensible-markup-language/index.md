# Extensible Markup Language (XML)

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that is designed to store and transport data. It is a simple and flexible language that is similar to HTML, but is not designed to display data. Instead, it is used to describe and structure data, making it easy to share and exchange between different applications.

XML is based on a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It uses tags, similar to HTML, to define elements and attributes that describe the data. These tags are used to create a tree-like structure that represents the relationships between the data elements.

XML has become a popular standard for data exchange and storage, particularly on the web. It is used in a variety of applications, such as:

* Data exchange: XML is used to exchange data between different systems, such as web services, where the data needs to be shared between different platforms and languages.

* Configuration files: XML is often used to store configuration data for applications, such as web servers and content management systems.

* Data storage: XML databases are used to store large amounts of structured data, such as scientific data, financial data, and multimedia content.

* Syndication: XML is used to syndicate content on the web, such as news feeds, podcasts, and blogs.

XML is not a programming language, but it can be used in conjunction with other languages, such as Java, PHP, and .NET, to create dynamic web applications. It is also used in conjunction with other standards, such as XML Schema, XSLT, and XPath, to provide additional functionality for validating and transforming data.
