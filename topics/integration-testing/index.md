# Integration testing

Integration testing is a software testing technique that tests the interaction between different modules or components of an application to ensure they work together as intended. The purpose of integration testing is to detect errors that arise due to the integration of individual modules.

During integration testing, individual modules are combined and tested as a group, and the goal is to ensure that they work together seamlessly. Integration testing can be performed at different levels, including:

* Big Bang Integration: All the components are integrated together and tested as a whole.

* Top-Down Integration: Testing starts from the topmost module, and lower-level modules are added progressively.

* Bottom-Up Integration: Testing starts from the lowest-level modules, and higher-level modules are added progressively.

* Hybrid Integration: A combination of the above three approaches.

The testing team creates test cases to ensure that each module is properly integrated with the others. Integration testing is typically conducted after unit testing and before system testing. The aim is to catch any errors that may occur due to the interaction between modules before they reach the end-users.

Integration testing can be automated or manual. Automated testing is preferred when the application has frequent updates, and the number of modules is high. The benefits of integration testing include early detection of defects, reduced development costs, and improved quality of the software product.
