# Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a security property that ensures that a compromise of a long-term secret key cannot compromise past or future session keys. It is a security feature that is commonly used in encryption protocols to protect communication between two or more parties.

In traditional key exchange methods, the same key is used for multiple sessions, which creates a security risk if the key is compromised. With PFS, each session uses a unique key that is generated on the spot and discarded after the session ends. This ensures that even if a key is compromised, it cannot be used to compromise past or future session keys.

PFS can be implemented using several cryptographic protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, or RSA key exchange with forward secrecy enabled. These protocols generate a new session key for each session, ensuring that even if the private key of a server or client is compromised, previously recorded encrypted communications cannot be decrypted.

PFS is important for protecting sensitive communications over untrusted networks, such as the internet. By implementing PFS, organizations can ensure that even if their long-term secret key is compromised, past or future communication remains secure.
