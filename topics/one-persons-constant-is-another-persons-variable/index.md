# One person's constant is another person's variable

The quotation "One person's constant is another person's variable" is a humorous and insightful saying in computer science. It highlights the subjective nature of coding and how different developers may perceive and use the same elements in their code differently.

In programming, a "constant" is a value that remains unchanged throughout the program's execution, while a "variable" is a value that can change during runtime. The quote plays on the idea that what one programmer may consider as a constant (unchanging value) might be treated as a variable (a value that can change) by another programmer, depending on their perspective and the context in which the code is used.

This saying is often used to emphasize that coding styles and design choices can vary greatly among different developers. What one person chooses to define as a constant may be suitable for their specific use case, but another developer might find it more appropriate to treat the same value as a variable in a different context.

The quote serves as a gentle reminder to be mindful of different perspectives and coding practices while collaborating on projects or reviewing code written by others. It reinforces the importance of clear communication and documenting code to ensure that the intent behind each design choice is evident and understood by all team members. Ultimately, the goal is to create code that is not only correct and efficient but also easily maintainable and comprehensible to all who work with it.
