# Distributed database

A distributed database is a database system that consists of multiple interconnected databases that are distributed over a computer network. It is designed to store, manage, and retrieve large volumes of data across multiple sites and geographical locations. In a distributed database, each site has its own database management system (DBMS), and the DBMS at each site can communicate with each other to share data and maintain consistency.

The main advantage of a distributed database is that it allows for the efficient sharing of data and resources among multiple sites. By distributing data across multiple sites, it can reduce data redundancy and improve data availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. It also allows organizations to store data closer to where it is needed, which can improve performance and reduce network traffic.

However, managing a distributed database can be challenging, and it requires specialized skills and tools. Ensuring data consistency and integrity across multiple sites can be difficult, and data replication and synchronization can be complex. Security and access control can also be more challenging in a distributed environment.

To address these challenges, distributed databases often use specialized software and protocols, such as distributed transaction processing, distributed locking, and distributed query optimization. Some examples of popular distributed database systems include Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and Google Cloud Spanner.
