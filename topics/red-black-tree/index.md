# Red-black tree

A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree (BST) data structure. It provides efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and searching. Red-black trees maintain a roughly balanced structure, which guarantees that the longest path from the root to any leaf node is at most twice as long as the shortest path. These trees are suitable for a wide range of applications.

Key aspects:

* Node Color: Each node in the tree is either red or black.

* Root Property: The root of the tree is always black.

* Red Property: Red nodes cannot have red children.

* Black Depth Property: For each node, any simple path from this node to any of its descendant leaves must have the same number of black nodes. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced.

Simplified overview of insertion and deletion:

* Insert: Insert the new node into the tree as in a regular BST. Color the new node red (violating the Red Property). Rebalance the tree by applying a set of rotations and recoloring of nodes while ensuring that all Red-Black Tree properties are maintained.

* Delete: Delete the node as in a regular BST. If the deleted node is red or has a red child, simply delete it without affecting the tree's balance. If the deleted node is black, perform  steps to maintain the tree properties; this may involve "fix-up" operations such as rotations and recoloring.
