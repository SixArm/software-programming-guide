# Error detection algorithms

Error detection algorithms are techniques used in data communication and storage systems to detect errors that may occur due to various factors such as noise in transmission, hardware faults, or data corruption. These algorithms are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of data.

Some common ones:

* Checksum: Checksums are simple and efficient error detection techniques. A checksum is calculated from the data bits, and the sender transmits both the data and the checksum. The receiver recalculates the checksum and checks if it matches the received checksum. If they don't match, an error is detected.

* Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): CRC is a more robust error detection technique commonly used in network communication. It involves polynomial division and is capable of detecting a wider range of errors compared to simple checksums.

* Parity Bits: Parity bits are used in binary data to ensure an even or odd number of set bits. If the expected parity (even or odd) doesn't match the received parity, an error is detected.
