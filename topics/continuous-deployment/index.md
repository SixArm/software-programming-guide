# Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software development practice that builds upon Continuous Integration (CI) by automatically deploying code changes to production environments after they pass all tests and quality checks. The goal of CD is to reduce the time between writing code and getting it into the hands of users, while maintaining a high level of quality and reliability.

CD involves several key stepsâ€¦

Continuous Integration: Code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository and automatically tested and validated to ensure that they meet the required standards for deployment.

Automated Deployment: When code changes pass all tests and quality checks, they are automatically deployed to production environments without requiring human intervention.

Monitoring: After deployment, the application is monitored for any issues or errors, and automated alerts are generated if any problems are detected.

Rollback: If any issues are detected, the CD system can automatically rollback the deployment to a previous version to ensure that users are not impacted.

Continuous Deployment is designed to streamline the software delivery process by automating testing, deployment, and monitoring, while ensuring a high level of quality and reliability. It allows development teams to focus on writing code rather than managing deployments, and enables organizations to rapidly deliver new features and updates to users.
