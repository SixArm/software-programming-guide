# SQL injection

 SQL injection (SQLi) is a type of cyber attack that targets SQL-based databases used in websites and applications. It is a form of injection attack that enables attackers to manipulate the database by inserting malicious SQL commands through web input fields, such as search boxes or login forms.

In a SQL injection attack, the attacker sends input data to the server in such a way that it gets executed as part of an SQL query. This can allow the attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information, modify or delete data, or even take control of the server.

There are several ways to perform a SQL injection attack, but the most common method is by injecting SQL code into a web application's input fields. For example, an attacker could insert code into a search box, and the code attempt to  effectively terminate the original SQL query, then append a new clause that runs and always evaluates to true (1=1).

The consequences of a successful SQL injection attack can be severe, including data loss, data corruption, and loss of reputation. To prevent SQL injection attacks, developers must use secure coding practices, such as parameterized queries and input validation, and keep their software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
