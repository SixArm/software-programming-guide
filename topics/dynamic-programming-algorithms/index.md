# Dynamic programming algorithms

Dynamic programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique used in computer science and mathematics. It is used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving them in an optimal way. The approach is based on the principle of optimal substructure, which means that the optimal solution to a problem can be built from the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

One of the key benefits of Dynamic Programming is that it can reduce the time complexity of an algorithm by avoiding the repeated computation of subproblems. This is achieved by storing the solutions to subproblems in a table or array, so that they can be reused in the computation of larger subproblems.

Some popular Dynamic Programming algorithms include the Knapsack problem, the Longest Common Subsequence problem, and the Edit Distance problem.

Steps:

1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.

2. Define the value of an optimal solution recursively in terms of smaller subproblems.

3. Compute the value of an optimal solution in a bottom-up fashion, by solving the subproblems in order of increasing size.

4. Construct an optimal solution to the problem from the computed information.
