# Procedural programming (PP)

Procedural programming (PP) is a programming paradigm in which the program is designed and structured around a sequence of procedures or subroutines that are executed in a specific order. The procedures in procedural programming are typically grouped together based on their functionality and are often referred to as functions or methods.

In procedural programming, the program is divided into smaller pieces of code, each of which performs a specific task. These smaller pieces of code can be easily reused and maintained, which makes it easier to manage large, complex programs. Procedural programming is often used for tasks that involve a lot of data processing, such as scientific simulations, data analysis, and engineering applications.

One of the key features of procedural programming is the use of variables. Variables are used to store data that can be accessed and manipulated by the program's procedures. Procedures in procedural programming are designed to operate on these variables, which can be passed between procedures as arguments.

Procedural programming also makes use of control structures, such as loops and conditional statements, to control the flow of the program. These structures allow the program to make decisions based on the data it is processing and to repeat certain operations until a condition is met.

Procedural programming languages include languages like C, Pascal, and Fortran. These languages are typically used for system programming, scientific computing, and other tasks that require a high degree of performance and control over system resources. However, procedural programming has some limitations, such as difficulty in handling complex data structures and a lack of modularity, which can make it more difficult to maintain and scale larger programs.
