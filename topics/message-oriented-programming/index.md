# Message-oriented programming

Message-oriented programming is a style of programming that focuses on the exchange of messages between different software components or services rather than the sharing of data. The main idea is that each component should be self-contained and only communicate with others through the exchange of messages. This approach helps to decouple components from each other, making it easier to modify or replace them without affecting the rest of the system.

In message-oriented programming, each message is an independent entity with its own unique identifier and payload. The payload contains the data that needs to be transferred between the components. Messages can be sent between components synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the needs of the system.

The message-oriented programming approach has several benefits. First, it provides loose coupling between components, meaning that components can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of each other. This makes the development process more efficient, as changes to one component don't require changes to other components. Additionally, it helps to improve fault tolerance, as errors in one component won't necessarily impact the rest of the system.

Message-oriented programming is commonly used in distributed systems, where components are spread across different servers or even different geographic regions. In these systems, message-oriented programming helps to ensure that data is transferred efficiently and reliably between components.

Some popular message-oriented programming languages are Smalltalk and Self.
