# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a type of security system that is designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in order to detect and alert security personnel of potential security threats, including attempts at unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activity.

IDS systems can be classified into two main categories: network-based and host-based. Network-based IDS systems monitor network traffic at the network layer, looking for suspicious activity such as network scanning, port scanning, and other forms of network reconnaissance. Host-based IDS systems, on the other hand, monitor system and application logs on individual hosts, looking for signs of suspicious activity such as unauthorized access attempts, file modifications, or other unusual activity.

IDS systems typically use a combination of signature-based and behavior-based detection methods. Signature-based detection involves comparing network traffic or system logs to known patterns or signatures of known attacks, while behavior-based detection involves looking for patterns of activity that are indicative of an attack, even if the attack itself is not yet known.

When an IDS system detects a potential security threat, it typically generates an alert or notification to a security operations center (SOC) or other security personnel, who can then investigate the alert and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat.
