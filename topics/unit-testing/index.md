# Unit testing

Unit testing is a software testing technique that verifies individual units or components of a software system. A unit is a smallest testable part of an application, which could be a method, function, class, or module. The primary purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected and satisfies the specified requirements.

The main idea behind unit testing is to isolate a unit from the rest of the software system and test it in an automated and repeatable way. This is typically achieved by writing test cases that exercise the unit's functionality and compare the actual results with the expected results. If the results match, the test passes; otherwise, it fails and indicates a defect in the unit.

The benefits of unit testing are numerous. By catching defects early in the development cycle, unit testing helps reduce the overall cost of fixing bugs. It also helps improve the quality of the code by forcing developers to write testable and maintainable code. Unit tests also serve as a form of documentation, describing the expected behavior of each unit.

Unit testing can be performed using a variety of testing frameworks and tools, such as JUnit, NUnit, pytest, and others. These tools provide developers with a way to automate the process of running test cases and reporting the results. Many modern integrated development environments (IDEs) also provide built-in support for unit testing, making it easier for developers to write and run tests.

Unit testing is typically integrated into the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline of a software project, allowing tests to be run automatically whenever code changes are made. This helps ensure that changes to the codebase do not introduce new defects or break existing functionality.
