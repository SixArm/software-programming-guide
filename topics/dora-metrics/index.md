# DORA metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics are a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that are used to evaluate software development and delivery processes, with a focus on improving productivity, quality, and speed. DORA metrics were developed by a team of researchers from the DORA organization, which was acquired by Google in 2018.

The four DORA metrics are:

* Lead time for changes: This metric measures the time it takes to go from code commit to code deployed. This includes code review, testing, and other processes required to get the code ready for deployment.

* Deployment frequency: This metric measures how frequently new code changes are deployed to production.

* Mean time to restore (MTTR): This metric measures the average time it takes to restore service after a failure or incident occurs.

* Change failure rate: This metric measures the percentage of changes that result in a failure or cause a service outage.

DORA metrics are designed to provide insights into the performance of software development and delivery processes, and to help organizations identify areas for improvement. By tracking these metrics over time, organizations can determine if their software development processes are becoming more efficient, and if their changes are having a positive impact on their business. DORA metrics have become increasingly popular in the DevOps community, as they provide a way to measure the effectiveness of DevOps practices and processes.
