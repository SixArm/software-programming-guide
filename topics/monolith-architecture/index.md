# Monolith architecture

Monolith architecture is a software architecture pattern in which an entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. This architecture is in contrast to microservices architecture, where an application is composed of small, independent services.

A monolith project is typically developed, tested, and distributed using one codebase, one technology stack, one database, and so forth. All modules, components, and features are contained within the same codebase.

Monolith architecture has its strengths and weaknesses. It is often more straightforward to develop initially, especially for smaller applications. However, as applications grow in complexity and scale, monoliths can become unwieldy and challenging to manage. This has led to the rise of microservices architecture, which emphasizes breaking down applications into smaller, independent services, each with its own codebase and data storage.

Scaling a monolithic application involves scaling the entire application, which can be inefficient if only specific components require more resources. As the application grows, it can become increasingly challenging to maintain, update, and extend. Codebase complexity can lead to slower development and a higher risk of errors.
