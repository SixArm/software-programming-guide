# N-queens problem

The n-queens problem is a classic problem in computer science that involves placing n chess queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can be placed on the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem was first proposed in the mid-1800s and has since been studied extensively in the field of combinatorial optimization.

The n-queens problem is an example of a constraint satisfaction problem, where the goal is to find a solution that satisfies a set of constraints. The problem is typically solved using a recursive backtracking algorithm, which starts by placing a queen in the first column of the board and then recursively tries to place queens in the remaining columns. If a solution cannot be found in a particular branch of the search tree, the algorithm backtracks to the previous branch and tries a different option.

The complexity of the n-queens problem increases rapidly as the size of the chessboard (n) increases. For example, the number of possible solutions for a 4 x 4 chessboard is 2, while the number of possible solutions for an 8 x 8 chessboard is 92. However, the problem can be solved efficiently for small values of n using a simple recursive algorithm.

The n-queens problem has important applications in fields such as computer science, operations research, and artificial intelligence. It is often used as a benchmark problem for testing algorithms that solve constraint satisfaction problems and has been used to develop new optimization algorithms and heuristics. Additionally, variations of the n-queens problem have been used in computer security to test intrusion detection systems and in robotics for path planning and navigation.
