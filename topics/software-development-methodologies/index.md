# Software development methodologies

Software development methodologies are structured approaches for the development process, including planning, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

Some common software development methodologiesâ€¦

Waterfall: This is a linear sequential approach with distinct phases, such as design, implement, test, and maintain. This approach works with complete up-front requirements that never change.

Agile: This prioritizes adaptability and collaboration over predictability and planning. Agile focuses on improvements, feedback, and flexibility. Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban emphasize teamwork, communication, and rapid prototyping.

Lean Development: This aims to minimize waste and maximize customer value. It involves iterative development, continuous improvement, and a focus on reducing waste and eliminating non-value-added activities. Lean prioritizes customer feedback.

Spiral Model: This emphasizes risk analysis and mitigation. It involves multiple iterations of planning, designing, building, and testing. The spiral model is often used for large, complex projects with high levels of risk.

Rapid Application Development (RAD): This prioritizes rapid prototyping and iterative development. It involves a collaborative approach that includes users and stakeholders in the development process to ensure that the final product meets their needs.

Extreme Programming (XP): XP is an agile methodology that emphasizes continuous feedback, rapid prototyping, and a collaborative approach to software development. It includes practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration to improve quality.
