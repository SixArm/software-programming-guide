# Composition

Composition is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering that refers to the practice of creating complex objects or structures by combining simpler or more elementary objects or components. Composition is widely used to build systems in a modular, flexible, and maintainable way. 

Composition is often used to model a "has-a" relationship between objects. This relationship implies that an object contains or is composed of other objects. For instance, a "Car" has an "Engine" and "Wheels."

Composition offers greater flexibility compared to inheritance (another OOP concept). With composition, objects can be composed of different components, and those components can be replaced or extended without affecting the rest of the system.

Composition can be based on interfaces or contracts, where components adhere to a specific interface. This allows objects to interact with components that conform to a common set of methods.

Composition is often used in dependency injection, where a component's dependencies are injected from external sources, making it easier to manage and test those dependencies.

Large software systems are often constructed by composing various modules, libraries, and components. This approach simplifies system architecture and reduces the complexity of individual components.

Several design patterns, such as the Composite Pattern, Decorator Pattern, and Strategy Pattern, are based on the concept of composition and provide solutions to common software design problems.
