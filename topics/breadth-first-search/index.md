# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore and search through a graph or tree data structure. 

BFS systematically explores the graph level by level, ensuring that nodes closer to the starting node are visited before nodes farther away. This makes BFS particularly useful for finding the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in unweighted graphs.

BFS is generally implemented using a queue data structure, with nodes enqueued and dequeued in the order they were added. This ensures that nodes at the same distance from the start node are visited before nodes farther away.

BFS is unlike Depth-First Search (DFS), which explores as far as possible along a single branch before backtracking. 

BFS is often used in applications like shortest path finding, connected component analysis, exploring the structure of graphs, web crawling, and maze solving.
