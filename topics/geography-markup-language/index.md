# Geography Markup Language (GML)

Geography Markup Language (GML) is an XML-based encoding for the representation and exchange of geographical features, their attributes, and their relationships. It is an open standard format for describing geographical data, and it was developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to support interoperability between different software systems.

GML is used to represent various kinds of geographical information, such as maps, terrain, and buildings, and it can be used for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data. It provides a common language for communicating geographical data between different applications, and it allows data to be shared and integrated across different platforms and systems.

GML consists of a set of elements that define the structure of the data, including features, geometry, and attributes. It provides a flexible and extensible framework that can be customized to meet the needs of specific applications.

GML is widely used in the geospatial industry, including applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), mapping, and spatial data management. It is also used in web-based mapping services, where it enables the creation of interactive maps and geospatial applications.
