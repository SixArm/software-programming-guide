# Kalman filter

The Kalman filter is a mathematical algorithm used for state estimation and control of systems that have uncertain and noisy measurements or predictions. It was developed by Rudolf Kalman in the 1960s and has found extensive use in a variety of fields, including engineering, finance, and physics.

The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that uses a series of measurements and predictions to estimate the current state of a system. It works by combining the current measurement with the predicted state of the system to produce an optimal estimate of the current state. The filter uses a set of mathematical equations that describe the dynamics of the system and the statistical properties of the measurement and prediction errors.

The Kalman filter can handle non-linear systems by using a linear approximation around the current state estimate. It also has the ability to account for time-varying noise and uncertain dynamics by adjusting the filter parameters over time. This makes it a powerful tool for tracking and control of complex systems.

The Kalman filter has many applications, including navigation, robotics, target tracking, and financial forecasting. For example, it can be used to estimate the position and velocity of a moving object using noisy sensor data, or to predict the future price of a stock based on historical data and current market conditions.

While the Kalman filter is a powerful tool, it does have some limitations. It assumes that the system being modeled is linear and that the measurement and prediction errors are Gaussian and uncorrelated. It also requires accurate estimates of the system dynamics and noise statistics to work effectively.
