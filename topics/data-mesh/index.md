# Data mesh

Data mesh is an architectural paradigm for designing and building scalable and flexible data platforms.
The core idea is to treat data as a product and create a self-serve platform that allows data producers and consumers to collaborate and exchange data in a seamless and secure way. This is achieved by breaking down the monolithic data architecture into smaller, decentralized units called "domains", which are responsible for managing their own data, schema, and access policies. Each domain is led by a "Domain Owner", who is responsible for the quality, governance, and delivery of data within that domain.

Data mesh also introduces the concept of "Data Products", which are self-contained and reusable units of data that are designed to serve a specific business need. Each data product is owned by a "Product Owner", who is responsible for defining the data product's schema, quality, and delivery. The data product can then be consumed by other teams within the organization through a self-service platform that provides a unified view of all available data products.

Data Mesh also uses these patternsâ€¦

Federated Data Governance: A decentralized governance model that allows each domain to define its own data governance policies and practices.

Domain-Driven Design: A software development approach that focuses on designing software based on the domain model and business needs.

Infrastructure as Code: A practice of defining and managing infrastructure through code, which allows for better scalability, reproducibility, and automation.

API-First Design: A design approach that prioritizes the definition of APIs before the implementation of backend systems, which allows for better flexibility and interoperability.
