# Data-in-motion

Data-in-motion refers to data that is being transmitted or processed between two or more points in a network. This can include data transmitted between computers, mobile devices, servers, or other devices on a network, as well as data that is being processed by applications or services.

Data-in-motion can take many different forms, including emails, instant messages, video and voice calls, file transfers, and data streams between applications. While data-in-motion is being transmitted or processed, it is vulnerable to interception, tampering, or theft. Therefore, data-in-motion must be protected through secure data transmission protocols and encryption methods.

Secure data transmission protocols, such as HTTPS, SFTP, or SSL, ensure that data is transmitted between endpoints in an encrypted and authenticated manner. Encryption methods, such as AES, RSA, or SHA, provide an additional layer of security by transforming the data into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted with the appropriate decryption key.

Data-in-motion security is essential for protecting sensitive data, such as personal information, financial data, and confidential business data, from unauthorized access, theft, or interception during transmission. It is also important to secure data-in-motion to comply with regulations and industry standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
