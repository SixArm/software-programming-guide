# Aho-Corasick algorithm

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm that efficiently finds multiple patterns (often referred to as a "dictionary" of patterns) within a longer text string. It was specifically designed to handle the problem of searching for multiple patterns in a single pass through the text, making it very efficient for this type of task.

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is often used for applications like string matching, keyword searching, and intrusion detection systems where you need to identify multiple keywords or patterns simultaneously in a text.

**Key aspects:**

* **Trie Data Structure**: The algorithm constructs a trie (prefix tree) from the set of patterns. Each path from the root of the trie to a node represents a prefix of one of the patterns. Nodes in the trie are labeled with characters, and there is a failure function that helps navigate the trie efficiently.

* **Failure Function**: The failure function, also known as the "failure link" or "failure transition," is a key concept in the Aho-Corasick algorithm. It provides a link from a node to another node in the trie that represents the longest possible proper suffix of the current node. This link allows the algorithm to efficiently backtrack in case of a mismatch.

* **Output Function**: The output function associates each node in the trie with the patterns that can be matched by traversing the path from the root to that node. This allows the algorithm to identify all occurrences of patterns in the text.

* **Matching**: The Aho-Corasick algorithm efficiently matches the patterns against the text by traversing the trie and following the failure links in case of a mismatch. It can find all occurrences of multiple patterns in a single pass through the text.
