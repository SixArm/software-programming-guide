# Actor programming

Actor programming is a model for designing and implementing concurrent and distributed systems. The actor model defines a way of organizing computation as a collection of independent actors that communicate with each other by exchanging messages. Each actor has its own local state, and processing of messages can result in the actor updating its state and sending messages to other actors.

In the actor model, actors are the fundamental unit of computation, and they are encapsulated in their own processes or threads. Actors interact with other actors by sending and receiving asynchronous messages, which means that actors do not block and can continue processing other messages while waiting for a response.

Actors are designed to be lightweight and have minimal shared state, which makes them well suited for distributed systems where latency and fault tolerance are critical. In an actor-based system, actors can be distributed across multiple machines, and the actor model provides mechanisms for load balancing, failure detection, and recovery.

One of the benefits of using actors is that they provide a natural way to reason about concurrency and parallelism. By encapsulating state and behavior within actors, the complexity of concurrent systems can be managed, and the system can be designed to be more resilient and fault tolerant. Actors can also be used to build reactive systems that respond to events and are scalable and resilient.

Some popular actor-based programming frameworks and languages include Akka, Orleans, Erlang, and Scala.
