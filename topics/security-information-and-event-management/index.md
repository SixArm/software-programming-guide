# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a type of software that provides security professionals with a comprehensive view of their organization's security posture by collecting, aggregating, and analyzing security events from various sources in real-time.

SIEM systems collect logs and events from a variety of sources, including network devices, servers, applications, and security products such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. The system then normalizes and correlates this data to provide a holistic view of security across the enterprise.

SIEM solutions use a combination of signature-based detection and behavioral analysis to identify security incidents. Signature-based detection involves comparing incoming events to a database of known threat signatures, while behavioral analysis uses machine learning and statistical modeling to identify patterns of behavior that may indicate a security threat.

Once a potential security incident is identified, the SIEM system generates alerts and/or triggers automated response actions, such as blocking traffic or isolating an infected device. The system can also provide detailed reports and dashboards to help security professionals understand the current state of security within the organization, and identify trends and areas for improvement.
