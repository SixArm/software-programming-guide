# Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a software architecture approach for communication between different applications or software components that are distributed across different computers or devices.

The RPC process typically involves the following stepsâ€¦

The client program sends a request to the server, including the name of the function or procedure to be executed, and any parameters that are needed.

The RPC framework on the client side packages the request into a message and sends it over the network to the server.

The server receives the request, unpacks it, and invokes the specified function or procedure, using the provided parameters.

The function or procedure executes on the server, and returns the result to the server-side RPC framework.

The RPC framework on the server side packages the result into a message and sends it back over the network to the client.

The client-side RPC framework receives the response, unpacks it, and returns the result to the client program.

RPC is widely used in distributed systems to enable communication between different components or services. It can be used in a variety of contexts, including client-server architectures, microservices, and web services. Common implementations of RPC include Java RMI, Microsoft .NET Remoting, and Apache Thrift.
