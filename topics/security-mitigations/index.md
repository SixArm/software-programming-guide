# Security mitigations

Security mitigations refer to the measures or actions taken to reduce or eliminate security risks and vulnerabilities in software. These can be both proactive and reactive, designed to prevent security threats before they happen or respond to them once they have been detected.

Various typesâ€¦

Input validation: Check input data for correctness and preventing malicious inputs that could trigger security vulnerabilities or attacks.

Encryption: Use algorithms to convert data into a coded form, making it unreadable to anyone without the decryption key.

Access control: Use authentication and authorization, to verify the identity of users and ensure that they have the appropriate level of access and permissions.

Auditing: Monitorg the software for unusual or suspicious activity, and create logs or records of that activity for analysis.

Patching: Regularly update the software to address any known security vulnerabilities or issues.

Reduce attack surface: Remove or disable unnecessary features, functions or components that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
