# Regression testing

Regression testing is a type of software testing that aims to ensure that changes or updates to a software application or system do not introduce new bugs or issues that were not present in previous versions. It involves retesting the entire system or application, or a specific subset of features or functionalities, to verify that existing functionalities are still working as intended and that new changes have not introduced any negative impacts.

Regression testing is typically performed after a software update or change has been made, but it can also be performed on a regular basis as part of ongoing quality assurance efforts. The process of regression testing involves the following steps:

* Test plan creation - A test plan is created that outlines the scope of the regression testing, including which features or functionalities will be tested and the testing methods that will be used.

* Test case selection - Test cases are selected from existing test suites or created specifically for regression testing. These test cases should cover a range of functionalities and scenarios to ensure that all areas of the application are tested.

* Test execution - The selected test cases are executed on the updated software application or system.

* Defect reporting - Any defects or issues discovered during the testing process are documented and reported to the development team.

* Defect resolution - The development team fixes any defects or issues discovered during regression testing.

* Retesting - The fixed software application or system is retested to verify that the issues have been resolved and that the software is functioning as intended.
