# Algorithms

Algorithms are a set of step-by-step instructions or procedures used to solve a specific computational problem or perform a particular task. An algorithm consists of several components, including input, output, control structures, and instructions.

There are categories of algorithms, including:

* Sort Algorithms: Sort algorithms are used to arrange data in a specific order, such as in ascending or descending order. Some examples of sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

* Search Algorithms: Search algorithms are used to find a specific element or value within a data structure. Some examples of search algorithms include Linear Search, Binary Search, and Depth-First Search.

* Graph Algorithms: Graph algorithms are used to process data structures that are represented by nodes and edges, such as social networks and maps. Some examples of graph algorithms include Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Prim's Algorithm.

* Dynamic Programming Algorithms: Dynamic programming algorithms are used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. Some examples of dynamic programming algorithms include the Knapsack Problem and the Longest Common Subsequence Problem.

Algorithms are analyzed based on their time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run, while space complexity is a measure of how much memory an algorithm requires.
