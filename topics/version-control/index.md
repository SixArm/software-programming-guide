# Version control

Version control is a system used to manage changes to documents, code, or other types of files. It allows users to track and maintain a history of changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions of the files.

Benefitsâ€¦

Collaboration: Version control allows multiple users to work on the same files at the same time without overwriting each other's changes. This is particularly important for teams working on complex projects.

History tracking: Version control allows users to keep a record of all changes made to a file, including who made the changes, when they were made, and what the changes were. This makes it easy to track the history of a project and revert to previous versions if needed.

Backup and recovery: Version control systems provide a backup of all files and their changes, so users can recover lost or damaged files.

Branching and merging: Version control systems allow users to create branches, which are independent copies of the files that can be modified without affecting the main project. Branches can be merged back into the main project when changes are complete.

Access control: Version control systems allow administrators to control who has access to the files and what level of access they have.

There are two main types of version control systems: centralized and distributed. Centralized version control systems (CVCS) have a central server that stores the files and their changes. Distributed version control systems (DVCS) do not have a central server; instead, each user has a complete copy of the files and their changes.

Some popular version control systems are Git and Perforce. Some popular version control hosting platforms are GitHub and Bitbucket.
