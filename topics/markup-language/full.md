# Markup language

A markup language is a system for annotating text to define its structure, presentation, or semantics. Markup languages use special tags or codes that are embedded within the text to indicate how elements should be displayed or processed. These tags provide instructions to software applications or rendering engines on how to handle the content, allowing for consistent formatting and organization.

Markup languages are commonly used in various applications, including web development, document processing, and data representation. Some well-known markup languages include:

* Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages and define the structure and content of websites. It uses tags to specify headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements on a web page.

* Extensible Markup Language (XML): XML is a versatile markup language used for data representation and storage. It allows users to create custom tags to define the structure of data, making it suitable for exchanging information between different systems.

* eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML): XHTML is a combination of XML and HTML, following the rules of XML but maintaining the compatibility and structure of HTML. It was introduced to promote cleaner and more standardized web coding.

* eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT): XSLT is a language used to transform XML documents into different formats, such as HTML or other XML structures. It allows for data manipulation and presentation.

* Markdown: Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for easy readability and writing. It is often used to format documentation, readme files, and other plain-text content.

* Rich Text Format (RTF): RTF is a markup language used to represent formatted text and graphics in word processing documents. It is widely supported by various word processing software.

* LaTeX: LaTeX is a typesetting system often used for academic and scientific documents. It allows authors to focus on content while automatically handling document formatting.

Markup languages are essential for organizing and structuring content, whether for displaying web pages, exchanging data between applications, or creating structured documents. The use of markup languages has significantly contributed to the development of the internet, enabling standardized content presentation and data exchange across various platforms and devices.
