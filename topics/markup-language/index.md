# Markup language

A markup language is a system for annotating text to define its structure, presentation, or semantics. Markup languages use special tags or codes that are embedded within the text to indicate how elements should be displayed or processed. These tags provide instructions to software applications or rendering engines on how to handle the content, allowing for consistent formatting and organization.
