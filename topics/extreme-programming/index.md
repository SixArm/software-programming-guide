# Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that aims to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. It was first introduced in the late 1990s by Kent Beck and has since been widely adopted by software development teams around the world.

XP emphasizes teamwork, customer involvement, rapid feedback, and continuous improvement. The methodology is based on a set of values, principles, and practices that guide the development process. The core values of XP are communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect.

XP is centered around a number of practicesâ€¦

Planning: XP uses a planning process called "planning game" in which the development team and the customer work together to identify the features that will be included in each iteration.

Continuous integration: XP emphasizes the need for developers to integrate their code frequently and continuously, allowing them to detect and resolve problems quickly.

Test-driven development: XP promotes the use of automated testing to ensure that the code is working correctly and to catch any errors early in the development process.

Pair programming: XP encourages developers to work in pairs, with one developer writing the code and the other reviewing it.

Refactoring: XP emphasizes the importance of constantly improving the code by refactoring it to remove duplication, simplify complexity, and improve readability.

Simple design: XP advocates for a simple, minimalistic design approach that focuses on meeting the customer's needs without unnecessary complexity.
