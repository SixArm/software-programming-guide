# Graph Query Language (GraphQL)

Graph Query Language (GraphQL) is an open-source data query and manipulation language that was created by Facebook in 2012 to address the limitations of REST APIs. It enables clients to specify the structure of the data they require, and the server then returns only the requested data in a single response, reducing the number of round trips between the client and server.

GraphQL is based on a schema that defines the available data types, fields, and relationships between them. The schema is then used to generate a strongly-typed API that can be queried using the GraphQL syntax. The GraphQL syntax includes query, mutation, and subscription operations that can be used to retrieve, modify, or subscribe to changes in the data.

One of the key advantages of GraphQL is its flexibility. Clients can specify exactly what data they need, and the server returns only that data, reducing the amount of unnecessary data sent over the network. This can improve performance and reduce the load on the server.

GraphQL also allows for easy versioning of the API, as changes to the schema can be made without breaking existing clients. It also enables the use of tools such as GraphiQL, which provides a web-based interface for exploring and testing the API.

GraphQL has gained popularity in recent years, and is now supported by a number of major companies and open-source projects. It is often used in conjunction with front-end frameworks such as React and Angular, and is also used as a back-end technology in some cases.
