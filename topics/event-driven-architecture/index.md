# Event-driven architecture (EDA)

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an approach to software architecture that allows different software components to communicate with each other by exchanging events. An event in this context is a signal or a notification that some action or change has occurred within a system.

In EDA, the system is designed to respond to events in real-time, rather than being driven by a central control mechanism. This makes the system more responsive and flexible, and can also help to simplify the development process by allowing different components to be developed and deployed independently.

There are several key components in an event-driven architecture, including event producers, event consumers, event channels, and event processors. Event producers generate events and publish them to event channels, which act as the communication medium between producers and consumers. Event processors are responsible for processing incoming events and triggering appropriate actions or responses.

One of the key benefits of EDA is that it can help to decouple different components of a system, making them more modular and easier to maintain. It also allows for greater scalability, as new components can be added to the system without requiring major changes to the existing architecture.

EDA is commonly used in a variety of software applications, including financial trading systems, real-time analytics, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
