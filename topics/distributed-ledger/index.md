# Distributed ledger

A distributed ledger is a decentralized and tamper-resistant system for recording and storing transactions or data across multiple nodes or computers. It enables multiple parties to maintain a shared and synchronized database without relying on a central authority. Distributed ledgers are a core component of blockchain technology, but not all distributed ledgers use blockchain.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Decentralization: Each participating node in the network holds a copy of the entire ledger, and all nodes work together to validate and agree on the state of the ledger.

Consensus: Consensus mechanisms ensure that all nodes eventually agree on data and transactions. Examples include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).

Immutability: Once data is added to the distributed ledger, it becomes immutable and tamper-resistant. Each block of data is linked to the previous one, creating a chain of blocks (hence the term "blockchain" for specific implementations).

Security: Distributed ledgers require consensus from multiple nodes to make changes to the data, which makes it difficult for malicious actors to alter the data or commit fraud.

Smart Contracts (in some cases): Some distributed ledger platforms, such as Ethereum, support the execution of smart contracts; these automatically execute actions when specific conditions are met.

Permissioned and Permissionless Ledgers: Distributed ledgers can be permissioned, where only specific entities are allowed to participate, or permissionless, where anyone can join the network and participate.
