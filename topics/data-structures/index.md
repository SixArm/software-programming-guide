# Data structures

Data structures are the fundamental building blocks used to organize and store data in a computer program. They are essential in computer science because they enable the efficient management of large amounts of data, and are often used to implement algorithms and other data manipulation techniques.

A data structure is simply a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Some common examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each of these data structures has its own unique properties, advantages, and disadvantages.

Arrays are a basic data structure used to store collections of data in contiguous memory locations. They are efficient for accessing individual elements but can be inefficient for inserting or deleting elements from the middle of the array.

Linked lists store data in a linked sequence of nodes, where each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are useful for inserting and deleting elements but can be less efficient for accessing individual elements.

Stacks and queues are data structures used to store collections of elements that are accessed in a specific order. Stacks use the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, while queues use the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

Trees are hierarchical data structures that store data in nodes that are connected by edges. Each node has a parent and zero or more children, and the nodes can be traversed in various orders depending on the algorithm.

Graphs are more complex data structures that can be used to represent complex relationships between data elements. They consist of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect the vertices.
