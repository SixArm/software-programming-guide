# White hat versus black hat

White hat hackers and black hat hackers are two distinct categories of individuals involved in cybersecurity and hacking activities.

White Hat Hackers:

* Their primary goal is to improve security and protect against potential threats by reporting their findings to the affected parties.

* White hat hackers use their skills to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in computer systems, networks, and applications, often with the owner's permission, and typically legally and ethically.

* White hat hackers may work for organizations, governments, or independently as freelance security consultants. They often conduct penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security audits to ensure systems are adequately protected.

Black Hat Hackers:

* Their primary goal is malicious, such as cybercrime, identity theft, data breaches, ransomware attacks, vandalism, or denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

* Their actions are illegal and unethical, as they perform unauthorized intrusions, steal sensitive data, spread malware, or engage in other malicious activities.

* Their activities are punishable by law, and they face severe consequences if caught and prosecuted.
