# Database availability

Database availability refers to the ability of a database system to be accessible and responsive to users and applications, providing uninterrupted access to data and services. High database availability is crucial for ensuring that critical applications and services dependent on the database can function properly and without disruptions.

Some techniquesâ€¦

Replication: Replicating data across multiple database instances or servers in real-time can provide redundancy and fault tolerance. If one server goes down, the data remains accessible through the replicas.

Clustering: Clustering databases across multiple servers provides redundancy and load balancing, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

Failovers: If the primary server becomes unavailable, then automatically switch to a standby server . This reduces downtime and ensures continuous service.

Load Balancing: Distributing incoming database requests across multiple servers helps prevent overload on a single server and improves overall system responsiveness.

Disaster Recovery: Having a recovery plan and backups allows for the restoration of the database, data, and services in case of major failures or disasters.

Monitoring and Alerting: Monitoring the database's health and performance can help identify potential issues early on and trigger alerts for timely intervention.
