# Tom's Opinionated Markup Language (TOML)

Tom's Opinionated Markup Language (TOML) is a configuration file format designed to be easy to read and write for both humans and machines. It was created by Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub. TOML is based on the INI file format but is more structured and has additional features.

TOML is a text-based file format that is used to store configuration data for applications. It is designed to be easy to read and write, with a syntax that is easy to understand. TOML uses key-value pairs to store data, and it supports a wide range of data types including strings, integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and arrays.

TOML files use a simple syntax that is designed to be easy to understand. Each key-value pair is separated by an equal sign (=), and each key is separated from its value by a period (.) or a space. The values can be enclosed in single or double quotes, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets ([]).

TOML is widely used in the software development community for configuring applications, especially in the Rust programming language. It is also used in other programming languages like Python, Ruby, and Go. TOML files are often used for configuration files for applications, web servers, and other software.
