# Vector database

A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors, such as those used in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. These databases are optimized for efficient vector search, which is the process of finding the most similar vectors to a given query vector based on a specific similarity metric.

Unlike traditional databases that store data as rows and columns, vector databases store data as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Each vector corresponds to a data object, such as an image, document, or audio file, and each dimension of the vector represents a feature or attribute of the object.

Vector databases are often used in applications that require similarity search, such as recommendation systems, image and audio search engines, and natural language processing. By storing and indexing vectors, these databases can quickly retrieve the most relevant data objects based on a user's query.

One of the most popular types of vector databases is the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) database. These databases use techniques such as locality-sensitive hashing and tree-based indexing to speed up similarity search by identifying candidate vectors that are likely to be similar to the query vector. This allows the database to provide fast and accurate search results even for very large datasets.

Some examples of vector databases include: Faiss, Milvus, Hnswlib, and the Elasticsearch search engine that can be used as a vector database by indexing vectors using dense vectors or sparse vectors.
