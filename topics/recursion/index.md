# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique that involves calling a function or a method within itself. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems.

Recursion is based on the principle of iteration, where a function is called repeatedly with different inputs until a certain condition is met, which is known as the base case. The base case serves as the stopping criterion for the recursion, and it prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely.

The recursion process starts with the initial function call, which is also known as the parent function call. The parent function then calls itself with a smaller or simpler input, which is known as the child function call. The child function call executes the same code as the parent function, but with a different input value. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the recursion ends, and the function returns a result.

Recursion can be used to solve many problems, such as searching and sorting algorithms, tree and graph traversal, and dynamic programming. However, it is important to be cautious when using recursion because it can lead to performance issues and stack overflows if not implemented correctly.

Some of the advantages of using recursion include its ability to solve complex problems with less code, its simplicity and elegance, and its ability to break down problems into smaller and more manageable sub-problems. On the other hand, recursion can be challenging to debug and may require more memory and processing power than iterative solutions.
