# Social engineering

Social engineering is the art of manipulating people to take actions or divulge sensitive information that they would not otherwise do under normal circumstances. It is a psychological attack used by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.

Social engineering attacks can take various forms, such as phishing attacks, pretexting, baiting, quid pro quo, and tailgating. Phishing attacks use fraudulent emails or websites that appear to be legitimate to trick victims into providing personal information, such as usernames and passwords. Pretexting involves creating a scenario to persuade a victim to divulge information. Baiting involves offering something enticing to a victim in exchange for information. Quid pro quo involves offering a service or benefit to a victim in exchange for information or access. Tailgating involves following an authorized person into a restricted area or building.

The goal of social engineering is to exploit human vulnerabilities and weaknesses, such as trust, fear, greed, and curiosity. Cybercriminals use social engineering techniques to trick people into downloading malware, giving away passwords, or providing access to sensitive systems and data.

To prevent social engineering attacks, it is important to educate employees about the risks and to establish security policies and procedures that minimize the likelihood of successful attacks. This can include implementing strong authentication measures, monitoring network activity for unusual behavior, and conducting regular security awareness training.
